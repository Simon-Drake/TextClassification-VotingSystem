New PCR method to differentiate species in the Aspergillus niger aggregate.
The DNA that encodes the 5.8S gene of the ribosomal RNA and the two intergenic spacers ITS1 and ITS2 of the two proposed type strains of the Aspergillus niger aggregate (A. niger and Aspergillus tubingensis) have been sequenced. By comparison of sequences we have found that both species could be differentiated by RsaI digestion of the PCR products of the mentioned regions. This method could be a useful tool in the identification of strains of the A. niger aggregate, especially in studies that involve a large number of isolates.
