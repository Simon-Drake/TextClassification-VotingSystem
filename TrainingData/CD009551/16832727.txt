Amplification of DNA encoding entire type I polyketide synthase domains and linkers from streptomyces species.
Polyketides are a group of bioactive compounds from bacteria, plants, and fungi. To increase the availability of analogs for testing, the active sites of polyketide synthases are often substituted with homologous domains having altered substrate specificities. This study reports the design of polymerase chain reaction primers that enables isolation of entire active site domains from type I polyketide synthases with native interdomain linkers. This bypasses the need for further genetic screening to obtain functional units for use in genetic engineering. This is especially important in bioprospecting projects exploring new environments for bioresources.
