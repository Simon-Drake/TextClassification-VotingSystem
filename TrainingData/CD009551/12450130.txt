Cloning and expression of cytochrome P450 genes, belonging to a new P450 family, of the basidiomycete Lentinula edodes.
Three cytochrome P450 genes, named Le. cyp1, Le. cyp2, and Le. cyp3, were isolated from the basidiomycete Lentinula edodes. Le. cyp1 and Le. cyp2 contained coding regions of 1500 bp and 1497 bp, respectively, but Le. cyp3 was found to be a defective gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of Le. CYP1 (CYP510A1, 500 amino acids) and Le. CYP2 (CYP510A3, 499 amino acids) were highly similar to each other (87% identical) and they had 32-33% identities to that of Coprinus cinereus P450 (CYP502) and 27-28% identities to those of two Aspergillus P450s (CYP64 family). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the transcripts of Le. cyp1 and Le. cyp2 genes in the course of fruiting-body development of L. edodes showed that the primordium seems to contain larger amounts of these transcripts. The transcript levels of both of these genes in the stipe of the premature fruiting body were higher than those in the whole pileus and gill tissue.
