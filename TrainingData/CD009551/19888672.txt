Clinical itraconazole-resistant strains of Aspergillus fumigatus, isolated serially from a lung aspergilloma patient with pulmonary tuberculosis, can be detected with real-time PCR method.
The invasive aspergillosis, which is commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus), has increased in recent years. Traditional methods for finding out antifungal resistant strains would take more than 2 weeks, which cannot satisfy the needs of rapid detection. In this study, a real-time PCR method for detection of the serial itraconazole-resistant strains of A. fumigatus isolated from a lung aspergilloma patient was developed. The results showed that the TacMAN-MGB probes, which were covered the loci Gly54, Leu98, Gly138, and Met220 of the enzyme CYP51A coded by the gene cyp51A, as well as the 34-bp tandem repeated sequence in the promoter region (-288 and -322 from the start codon) of this gene, could detect the serial itraconazole-resistant strains of A. fumigatus in our study. Besides, this method takes just 6 h to complete the whole detection.
