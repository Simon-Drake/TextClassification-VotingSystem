[Detection of invasive aspergillosis by PCR and real-time PCR--benefits and drawbacks].
PCR detection of fungal pathogens in clinical samples has been discussed in journals for more than two decades. However, its use for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis is still controversial, despite the fact that molecular methods are routinely used in various fields of modern microbiology. These are e. g. genotyping of bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics, molecular epidemiology or routine detection of viral infections in clinical material. PCR methods have made the diagnostic applications faster, simpler and more accurate. This review deals with issues related to molecular methods for diagnosing invasive fungal infections and the main factors limiting their use in everyday clinical practice.
