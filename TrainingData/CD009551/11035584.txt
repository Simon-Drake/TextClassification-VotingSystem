Primary pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma with associated fungal ball in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
We describe a case of primary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the lung in a 44-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus. Low-grade pulmonary lymphomas in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients are rare and are described most commonly in pediatric patients. The gross, histologic, and molecular features of this unusual case are described.
