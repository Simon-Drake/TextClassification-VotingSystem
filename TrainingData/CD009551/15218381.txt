Intracellular expression of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin in Aspergillus terreus to alleviate the effect of a short break in aeration during culture.
A continuous supply of O(2) is important for itaconic acid production in Aspergillus terreus. Any interruption of aeration significantly reduces itaconic acid production. To overcome this effect, A. terreus M8 was transformed with the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene (vgb) which, as shown by Southern hybridization, was integrated into the recipient chromosome. The activity of the expressed hemoglobin was confirmed by a CO-difference spectrum. During itaconic acid production, the effect of a break in aeration during cultivation in the transformant with the vgb gene is alleviated. Additionally, the transformant shows improved itaconic acid production.
