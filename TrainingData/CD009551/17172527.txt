Cerebral aspergillosis diagnosed by detection of Aspergillus flavus-specific DNA, galactomannan and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in clinical specimens.
A case of cerebral aspergillosis was diagnosed by the detection of Aspergillus flavus-specific DNA in brain biopsy and serum specimens. The diagnosis was also supported by detection of elevated levels of galactomannan and (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan in serum specimens. Despite the presence of dichotomously branched septate hyphae in brain biopsy, the culture remained negative. The inability to isolate the organism in culture suggested that combined therapy of AmBisome and caspofungin was fungicidal for the fungus in the brain abscess.
