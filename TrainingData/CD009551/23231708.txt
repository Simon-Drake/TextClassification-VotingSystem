Application of diagnostic markers to invasive aspergillosis in children.
Early mycological detection of Aspergillus species is the cornerstone for a prompt diagnosis, appropriate treatment strategies, and improved survival of patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA), irrespective of age. However, the currently available laboratory tests for the diagnosis of IA include culture with direct microscopy, histology, and antigenic markers, such as galactomannan and beta-1, 3-d-glucan, Aspergillus spp. DNA detection by PCR, and imaging studies, such as high-resolution CT scan. However, all need further validation, especially in children. In this review we focus on the diagnosis of IA emphasizing the current perspectives, difficulties in interpretation, and the need of further evaluation from a pediatric point of view.
