Function analysis of steA homolog in Aspergillus oryzae.
The asexual ascomycete Aspergillus oryzae has an steA homolog in its genome. The steA homolog of A. oryzae was transcribed in the wild-type strain but steA disruption did not affect the phenotype of the disruptant strain. On the other hand, the steA-overexpressing strain showed the restriction of vegetative hyphal growth and conidiation, and the formation of balloon-shaped structures. The restriction of vegetative hyphal growth and conidiation were partially rescued by high osmolarity. In addition, the hyphal growth of the steA-overexpressing strain was inhibited by Calcofluor white, and the strain was found to be sensitive to cell-wall-degrading reagents. Increase of secretory cell-wall-degrading enzymes of the steA-overexpressing strain was detected. These results indicate that SteA regulates cell-wall-degrading enzymes and that the phenotypes of A. oryzae steA-overexpressing strain may be due to cell wall abnormalities. steA may participate in cell wall metabolism.
