Overall survival and fungal infection-related mortality in patients with invasive fungal infection and neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy in a tertiary care centre from 1995 to 2006.
OBJECTIVES: Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) contribute significantly to mortality and morbidity in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy for haematological malignancies. The present study investigates the overall survival (OS), infection-related mortality and changes in treatment of IFIs in our department from 1995 until 2006. METHODS: Outcomes of all chemotherapy courses were retrospectively evaluated using a standard questionnaire. Modified EORTC/MSG criteria for IFIs were applied: a positive PCR result for Aspergillus spp. in bronchoalveolar lavage was also defined as probable IFI. RESULTS: In total, 1693 chemotherapy courses in 592 patients were evaluated. Sixty-three percent of chemotherapy courses were given to treat acute myeloid leukaemia, with the rest for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or aggressive lymphoma. IFIs were observed in 139/592 patients [23.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20%-27%] and in 149/1693 courses (8.8%, 95% CI 8%-10%). IFI-related mortality was 56.9% in 1995-2001 and 28.6% in 2002-06, P < 0.001. Accordingly, median OS in patients with IFI increased: 54 days (95% CI 26-82 days) in 1995-2001 versus 229 days (95% CI 35-423 days) in 2002-06, P = 0.001. By multivariate analysis, factors predictive for better OS were controlled disease after chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 0.228, P < 0.001], possible IFI (in contrast to proven/probable IFI, HR 0.537, P = 0.005), age <60 years (HR 0.583, P = 0.008), time period 2002-06 (HR 0.612, P = 0.021) and use of novel antifungals (HR 0.589, P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with 1995-2001, IFI-related mortality decreased and OS in patients with IFI increased significantly in recent years. Improved OS was associated with controlled haematological disease, certainty of IFI diagnosis (possible), younger age, time period 2002-06 and the use of novel antifungals.
