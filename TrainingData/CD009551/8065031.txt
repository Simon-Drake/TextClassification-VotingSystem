[Detection of Aspergillus fumigatus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in the clinical samples from individuals with pulmonary aspergillosis].
Aspergillosis is a disastrous cause of mortality and morbidity in patients in an immunocompromised state and old lung tuberculosis. However, the diagnosis of aspergillosis remains unsettled. In the present study, we developed a test to detect the Aspergillus fumigatus DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinical samples including sputum and bronchial aspirations from the patients with aspergillosis. We selected 2 pairs of oligonucleotide primers and the DNA for the small subunit ribosomal RNA of aspergillus fumigatus and they were significantly amplified. Although isolation of Aspergillus DNA may reflect contamination and colonization without infection, no aspergillus DNA was found in sputum or bronchial aspirations from the patients with lung cancer or interstitial lung diseases except a case of pulmonary fibrosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis chronically received 20 mg of corticosteroid. There was a 100% correlation between the culture results and the nested PCR results in the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis. These findings indicate that PCR detection of aspergillus fumigatus might be valuable for the diagnosis of aspergillosis.
