Early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a young immunocompetent patient.
A 22-year-old insulin-dependent diabetic male was admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis. He developed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for which empirical antibiotic and antifungal therapy was started on the ward. On day 6, clinical and laboratory findings worsened, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Serum real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and led to antifungal therapy being initiated 48 hours before the results of the BAL culture were available. Despite early appropriate antifungal therapy, however, the patient died on day 22 while being supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
