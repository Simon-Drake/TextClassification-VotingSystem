[Construction, expression, purification and characterization of mutant of Aspergillus flavus urate oxidase].
We converted the TGC codon (307-309 bp) of Aspergillus flavus urate oxidase (UOX) gene to a GCC codon by using fusion PCR techniques to produce a C103A mutant. This gene was cloned into expression vector pET-42a (+) and then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The mutant protein (UOX-Ala103) was expressed in soluble form at high levels after induction with IPTG The expressed rUOX-Ala103 accounted for about 45% of total bacterial proteins, rUOX-Ala103 of up to 98% purity was obtained after purified using hydrophobic interaction and anion exchange. Western blotting showed that the anti-UOX antibody specifically recognized rUOX-Ala103. The mutant protein showed a 60% increased in vitro biological activities compared with native protein, and performed a good activity of degrading the uric acid in vivo.
