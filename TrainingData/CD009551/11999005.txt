Diagnosis and treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in neutropenic patients.
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neutropenic patients. Microbiological and serological tests are of limited value. The diagnosis should be considered in neutropenic patients with fever not responding to antibiotics, and typical findings on thoracic computed tomography scan. Whenever possible, diagnosis should be confirmed by tissue examination. Newer techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction may change the current diagnostic approach. Therapeutic strategies consist of prophylaxis in risk groups and the early application of antifungal agents in suspected or probable disease. Amphotericin B as desoxycholate or lipid formulation is the current standard medication in invasive infection, although it has major side effects. Its role is challenged by the new azole derivates, such as itraconazole and voriconazole, and the new echinocandins. Additional therapies with cytokines, such as granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and interferon-gamma, and with granulocyte transfusions are under evaluation. In selected cases lung resection is of proven diagnostic and therapeutic value. This paper analyses the current understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of invasive aspergillosis and reviews the actual diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in neutropenic patients.
