Cloning and characterization of a novel polygalacturonase-encoding gene from Aspergillus parasiticus.
Pectinases produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus are believed to play a significant role in the ability of these fungi to spread in cotton bolls and other crops. Utilizing a DNA probe, generated by PCR, of the Aspergillus niger pgaII gene, we have isolated a novel, constitutively expressed polygalacturonase (PG)-encoding gene (pecA) from an A. parasiticus cDNA library. DNA sequence analysis and the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of pecA demonstrated significant identity at the nucleotide and aa levels with other PG of fungal origin. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from A. parasiticus grown on either glucose or pectin as the sole carbon source showed that pecA was expressed during growth in both media.
