Value of an inhalational model of invasive aspergillosis.
Animal models of invasive aspergillosis have been used for virulence studies and antifungal efficacy evaluations but results have been inconsistent. In an attempt to reproduce human infection, many Aspergillus animal models have utilized a 'pulmonary route' for delivery of conidia, largely through intranasal instillation. However, several radiolabeled particle studies have shown that aerosol delivery is preferable to intranasal instillation to create a more homogenous delivery to the lungs. We hypothesized that an inhalational model would be more robust for studies of invasive aspergillosis pathogenesis and antifungal therapy. We developed an inhalational model of Aspergillus fumigatus infection using a Hinners inhalation chamber and demonstrated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction that this new inhalational model creates a more homogenous murine pneumonia, facilitating analysis of mutant strains and treatment regimens.
