The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger contains two "differentially regulated" trehalose-6-phosphate synthase-encoding genes, tpsA and tpsB.
Two genes encoding trehalose-6-phosphate synthase were cloned from Aspergillus niger. tpsA was cloned using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GGS1/TPS1 gene as a probe. It encodes a 517-amino acid polypeptide with 64-70% similarity to trehalose-6-phosphate synthase of S. cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Its transcription occurs constitutively and is enhanced on carbon-derepressing carbon sources, coinciding with the presence of a CreA-binding nucleotide motif in the 5'-noncoding region of tpsA. Disruption of tpsA only weakly reduces growth on glucose, and neither influences the glucose induction of a low affinity glucose permease nor interferes with the catabolite repression of a pectinase; it causes reduced the heat tolerance of conidia. tpsB was cloned by a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy. Its 480 amino acid sequence showed 76.5% identity to tpsA. Its transcription was hardly detectable at ambient temperatures but was enhanced strongly upon heat shock, which agrees with the presence of several copies of a C4T stress-responsive element in its 5'-upstream sequences. Hence the function of yeast GGS1/TPS1 has been split into two differentially regulated genes in A. niger, of which none appears to be involved in glucose sensing.
