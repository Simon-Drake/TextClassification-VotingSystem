Molecular epidemiology of invasive stomatitis due to Aspergillus flavus in patients with acute leukemia.
BACKGROUND: Invasive oral aspergillosis is a rare complication and only little information on the epidemiology of Aspergillus flavus infection is available. We present here the molecular analysis of the epidemiology of invasive stomatitis due to Aspergillus flavus in patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: During a 5-year period (1992-1996), six isolates of A. flavus were obtained from leukemic patients with invasive Aspergillus stomatitis. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) with three different PCR primers was carried out to investigate the DNA typing of the isolates. RESULTS: The molecular analysis using RAPD revealed that three isolates of A. flavus obtained in 1992 from three patients were of the same type, whereas each of the isolates from the other three patients had a distinct unique band, resulting in four groups of A. flavus. CONCLUSION: As the three patients with invasive oral aspergillosis detected in 1992 were infected by a single strain of A. flavus, the strain was suspected to have caused a nosocomial outbreak of invasive oral aspergillosis in the hematology unit.
