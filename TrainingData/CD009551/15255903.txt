A role for creD, a carbon catabolite repression gene from Aspergillus nidulans, in ubiquitination.
In Aspergillus nidulans, it is known that creB encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that forms a complex with the WD40 motif containing protein encoded by creC, that mutations in these genes lead to altered carbon source utilization and that the creD34 mutation suppresses the phenotypic effects of mutations in creC and creB. Therefore, creD was characterized in order to dissect the regulatory network that involves the CreB-CreC deubiquitination complex. CreD contains arrestin domains and PY motifs and is highly similar to the Rod1p and Rog3p proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An additional gene was identified in the A. nidulans genome that also encodes an arrestin and PY motif-containing protein, which we have designated apyA, and thus two similar proteins also exist in A. nidulans. In S. cerevisiae, Rod1p and Rog3p interact with the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p, and so the A. nidulans homologue of Rsp5p was identified, and the gene encoding this HECT ubiquitin ligase was designated hulA. CreD and ApyA were tested for protein-protein interactions with HulA via the bacterial two-hybrid system, and ApyA showed strong interaction, and CreD showed weak interaction, with HulA in this system.
