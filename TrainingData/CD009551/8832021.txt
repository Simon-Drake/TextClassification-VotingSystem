Lymphocytosis of donor origin in cerebrospinal fluid, and marrow aplasia after donor leukocyte infusion for EBV-lymphoproliferative disease.
A 29-year-old woman underwent a T cell-depleted unrelated donor transplant for CML in chronic phase. Sixty-three days after marrow infusion, the patient developed fevers and generalized lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy was consistent with monoclonal EBV-associated immunoblastic lymphoma for which the patient received 10(5) CD3-positive donor leukocytes per kilogram. Six days after leukocyte infusion the patient developed mental status changes without focal neurological deficit. MRI revealed no mass lesions. Cerebral spinal fluid revealed a white blood cell count of 1650 cells/mm3 which were shown to be T lymphocytes of donor origin. The CSF was tested and found to be PCR positive for EBV virus interval repeat 1 sequence (IR1). The lymphocytosis and mental status changes resolved without specific intervention. Subsequently she developed marrow aplasia, which was believed to be secondary to the infusion of donor leukocytes. Possible mechanisms for these two previously unreported side-effects of donor leukocyte infusion are discussed.
