Rapid diagnosis of azole-resistant aspergillosis by direct PCR using tissue specimens.
We report the use of PCR techniques on a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimen for direct detection of one dominant azole resistance mechanism in a case of disseminated invasive aspergillosis. Rapid detection of mutations associated with azole resistance directly in tissue significantly reduces diagnostic delay.
