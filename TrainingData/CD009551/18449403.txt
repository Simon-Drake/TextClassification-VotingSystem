Quantitative PCR analysis of fungi and bacteria in building materials and comparison to culture-based analysis.
Prolonged moisture on building materials can lead to microbial growth on them. Microbes can emit spores, metabolites and structural parts into the indoor air and thus, cause adverse health effects of people living and working in these buildings. So far, culture methods have been used for assessment of microbial contamination of building materials. In this work, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the detection of selected fungal and bacterial groups in 184 building materials of different types and compared the results with culture-based analysis. Nine either commonly found species, genera or groups of fungi, or those considered as moisture damage indicators, and one bacterial genus, Streptomyces, were determined using qPCR. Fungi and mesophilic actinomycetes were also cultivated using standard media and conditions of the routine analysis. The bacterial genus Streptomyces and the fungal group Penicillium/Aspergillus/Paecilomyces were the most prevalent microbial groups in all building material types, followed by Stachybotrys chartarum and Trichoderma viride/atroviride/koningii. The highest prevalences, concentrations and species diversity was observed on wooden materials. In general, the results of the two methods did not correlate well, since concentrations of fungi and streptomycetes were higher and their occurrence more prevalent when determined by qPCR compared to culture-based results. However, with increasing concentrations, the correlation generally increased. The qPCR assay did not detect Aspergillus versicolor and Acremonium strictum as often as culture.
