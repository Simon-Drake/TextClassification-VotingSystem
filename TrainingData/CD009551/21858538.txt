Polyphasic characterization of "Aspergillus nidulans var. roseus" ATCC 58397.
Polyphasic characterization of the echinocandin B producer Aspergillus nidulans var. roseus ATCC 58397 strain was carried out to elucidate its taxonomical status. According to its carbon source utilization and secondary metabolite spectrum as well as the partial beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and gamma-actin gene sequences, A. nidulans var. roseus belongs to the Emericella rugulosa species. Auxotroph mutants of A. nidulans var. roseus ATCC 58397 and E. rugulosa CBS 171.71 and CBS 133.60 formed stable heterokaryons on minimal medium with several A. nidulans strains, and in the case of A. nidulans var. roseus, even cleistothecia were developed.
