Strain improvement and genetic characterization of indigenous Aspergillus flavus for amylolytic potential.
Aspergillus flavus FCBP-231, a filamentous fungus, was genetically modified for its ability to reveal extra cellular alpha-amylase activity. For strain improvement, the selected strains were subjected to UV irradiation (5-40 min exposure) and EMS treatment (50-300 microg mL(-1)) for hyper activity of an alpha-amylase enzyme. The mutants were quantitatively compared with the parental strain. UV and chemical mutagenesis brought about a dramatic enhancement in enzymatic activity. The mutant strains Af-UV-5.3 and Af-Ch-5.7 exhibited 79 and 110% more enzyme activity than the native strain A. flavus FCBP-231. This improvement in enzyme activity of the mutants suggests that they are suitable strains to be used in biotechnology. RAPD-PCR analysis revealed different patterns of amplicons of native as well as mutant derivatives, which suggested that the mutation imparted changes in the genetic make up of the mutants probably involved enzyme production control.
