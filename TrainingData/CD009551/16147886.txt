Cloning and sequence analysis of putative glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene from Monascus purpureus KCCM11832.
Using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gpd1) was cloned from Monascus purpureus KCCM11832. The 2834 bp EcoRV-HindIII region harbored 1183 bp 5'-UTR containing such regulatory elements as CT box, common in fungal gpd's, and gpd box previously found exclusively in Aspergillus gpd's. Full-length cDNA was cloned by PCR, and its sequence was determined. Transcription starting point was located 88 bp upstream from start codon. Polyadenylation signal sequence occurred 201 bp downstream from stop codon. Region from start codon ATG to stop codon TAA including introns showed 62 approximately 69% nucleotide sequence identity to those of Aspergillus gpd's. Significant bias in third position, with pyrimidines favored over purines, was observed in codon usage. The deduced amino acid sequence had 81 approximately 85% identity to Aspergillus gpd's. Monascus purpureus GPD was located at the same clade with Aspergillus GPD's.
