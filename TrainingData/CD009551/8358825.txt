Detection of gene-disruption events in Aspergillus transformants by polymerase chain reaction direct from conidiospores.
We describe a rapid method for the identification of gene disruption events after DNA-mediated transformation of Aspergillus fumigatus. This involves a polymerase chain reaction in which the target DNA is added in the form of intact conidiospores. Using one primer specific to the plasmid DNA and a second primer specific to the target gene on the chromosome, it is possible to identify gene disruption events among the more common ectopic integrations approximately 4 h after sporulating transformants appear on selective medium.
