Fungal ribotoxins: a family of naturally engineered targeted toxins?
alpha-Sarcin, mitogillin, and restrictocin are small (approximately 17 kDa) basic robosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) produced by the Aspergilli that catalytically inactivate the large ribosomal subunits of all organisms tested to date. These three fungal ribotoxins act as specific ribonucleases by hydrolyzing one single phosphodiester bond in the universally conserved alpha-sarcin domain of 23-28S rRNAs and are among the most potent inhibitors of protein synthesis known. Previous molecular studies of ribotoxins indicated that they belong to the superfamily of ribonucleases and analysis of the mitogillin gene employing PCR-mediated site-specific mutagenesis suggests that certain domains in ribotoxins, which share homologies with motifs in ribosome-related proteins, may be responsible for the targeting of ribotoxins to the ribosome. The applications of the ribotoxins as tools in research and their uses as therapeutic and diagnostic agents are also reviewed in this paper.
