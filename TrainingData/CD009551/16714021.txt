Genomic and experimental evidence for a potential sexual cycle in the pathogenic thermal dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei.
All meiotic genes (except HOP1) and genes encoding putative pheromone processing enzymes, pheromone receptors and pheromone response pathways proteins in Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus nidulans and a putative MAT-1 alpha box mating-type gene were present in the Penicillium marneffei genome. A putative MAT-2 high-mobility group mating-type gene was amplified from a MAT-1 alpha box mating-type gene-negative P. marneffei strain. Among 37 P. marneffei patient strains, MAT-1 alpha box and MAT-2 high-mobility group mating-type genes were present in 23 and 14 isolates, respectively. We speculate that P. marneffei can potentially be a heterothallic fungus that does not switch mating type.
