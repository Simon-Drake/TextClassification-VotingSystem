Differentiation of Aspergillus niger by random amplification of polymorphic DNA.
The randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns of whole-cell lysates from five Aspergillus niger isolates, including one reference strain, two isolated from deep freeze, and two environmental strains from soil and plant infections, were investigated. PCR-RAPD analysis of genomic DNA was performed using eight primers (Tube-A1, Tube-A6, Tube-A17, Tube-B8, Tube-B11, Tube-B15, Tube-C5, Tube-C6). The RAPD assay discriminated between all strains. Comparison of deep freeze isolates showed identical RAPD patterns in some of the reference and environmental isolates. The data indicates that the RAPD technique is useful for fingerprinting A. niger.
