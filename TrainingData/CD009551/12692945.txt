[A case of sarcoidosis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura accompanied with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis].
A 54-year-old woman with a 21-year history of sarcoidosis was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea on exertion, weight loss, and the appearance of consolidation in chest radiographs. The serum level of soluble IL-2 receptor was high, and CT findings demonstrated mediastinal, hilar and abdominal lymphadenopathy. The histological findings of subpleural consolidation in a transbronchial lung biopsy of the left lung showed giant cells; and those of a CT-assisted biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymph node revealed non-caseous epithelioid cell granulomas. After the biopsy, severe thrombocytopenia (6,000/microliter) developed. With prednisolone treatment, the platelet count rose to normal and the subpleural consolidation on chest radiography was improved. Five weeks later, the had a productive cough with fever, rapidly progressive cavitary lesions and consolidation on chest radiography. Aspergillus fumigatus was detected in the sputum by PCR, and Aspergillus antigen was detected in the serum. She died of progressive respiratory failure, in spite of therapy with amphotericin B and itraconazole. We report a rare case of sarcoidosis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura accompanied with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.
