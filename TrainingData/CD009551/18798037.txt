Isolation of microorganisms and substances inhibitory to aflatoxin production.
Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. The contamination of crops, feeds, and foods with aflatoxins can have serious effects on the health of humans and animals. Although many studies have been done to develop aflatoxin-control strategies, most are limited in their effectiveness. As part of an effort to develop control procedures, we have devised simple and safe methods that are useful for identifying microorganisms that effectively inhibit aflatoxin production by fungi. These include the microtitre agar plate assay using norsolorinic acid-accumulating mutant fungi, the ultraviolet light photography method using an instant film, the tip culture method, a convenient RNA extraction method for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, and other methods. Results of a recent trial have shown that Achromobacter xylosoxidans significantly inhibited aflatoxin production by A. parsiticus, and that the main inhibitory substance produced by the bacterium was cyclo(L-leucyl-L-prolyl). This result confirms that the methods described herein are useful for identifying microorganisms that inhibit aflatoxin production by fungi and could contribute to the development of methods to reduce aflatoxin contamination in commodities.
