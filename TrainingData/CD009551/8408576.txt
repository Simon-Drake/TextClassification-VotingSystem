Typing of Aspergillus species and Aspergillus fumigatus isolates by interrepeat polymerase chain reaction.
Polymerase chain reaction amplification of repetitive DNA motifs allows discrimination of Aspergillus species. In a preliminary survey, the DNA fingerprints appear to be identical when isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus are compared. When a primer deduced from a prokaryotic repeat motif is used, Aspergillus fumigatus isolates originating from different patients or different anatomical locations can be typed individually.
