Contaminating insert degradation by preincubation colony PCR: a method for avoiding false positives in transformant screening.
Colony PCR is a convenient alternative to conventional plasmid isolation and restriction digestion for high-throughput screening of recombinant colonies. However, an insert carryover from the ligation mix, adhered to colony or agar plate, generates a substantial number of false positives. To avoid this, a simple single-tube technique involving pre-PCR nuclease incubation has been developed by optimizing a buffer system that provides nuclease action and PCR amplification sequentially. Results presented in this work provide a technique that is amenable for high-throughput screening of recombinant colonies.
