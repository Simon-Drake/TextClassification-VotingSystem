Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with spontaneous resolution and the diagnostic utility of PCR from tissue specimens.
This case describes a 61-year-old apparently immunocompetent female with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and eosinophilia who demonstrated spontaneous clinical and radiological recovery. The patient had a history of asthma and had been corticosteroid dependent until 2 months prior to her presentation. This report explores the role of PCR in confirming the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in circumstances where only histological data are available and highlights the fact that invasive infections with Aspergillus spp. can occur without profound immunological deficiency. The case also documents the resolution of IPA without specific therapy.
