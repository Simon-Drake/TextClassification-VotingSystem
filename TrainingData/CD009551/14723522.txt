Enhancing the enantioselectivity of an epoxide hydrolase by directed evolution.
[reaction: see text] The epoxide hydrolase (EH) from Aspergillus niger, which shows a selectivity factor of only E = 4.6 in the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of glycidyl phenyl ether, has been subjected to directed evolution for the purpose of enhancing enantioselectivity. After only one round of error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR), enantioselectivity was more than doubled (E = 10.8). The improved mutant enzyme contains three amino acid exchanges, two of which are spatially far from the catalytically active center.
