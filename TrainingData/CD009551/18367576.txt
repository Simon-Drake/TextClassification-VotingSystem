Repetitive-sequence-based PCR using the DiversiLab system for identification of Aspergillus species.
Repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) using the DiversiLab system was investigated for identification of Aspergillus. Ninety-five clinical isolates, identified by conventional methods, and five ATCC strains were tested. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) was performed on 2 isolates with discrepant rep-PCR and conventional results and 15 randomly selected outlier isolates. One isolate not identified by sequencing was excluded from analysis. After resolving discrepancies, all but one A. glaucus strain had >or=85% similarity to one or more strains of the same Aspergillus species in the mold database, thereby providing accurate identification. No isolate was misidentified.
