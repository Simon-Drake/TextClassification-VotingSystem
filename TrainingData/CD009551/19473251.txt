Specific detection of Aspergillus carbonarius by SYBR Green and TaqMan quantitative PCR assays based on the multicopy ITS2 region of the rRNA gene.
Agroproducts contaminated by ochratoxin A (OTA) represent a risk for human and animal health and, therefore, maximum limits have been established by Food Safety Authorities. Reduction of OTA contamination may be accomplished by early detection of OTA-producing fungal species using rapid, specific and sensitive detection and quantification by PCR-based methods. Aspergillus carbonarius is one of the most important OTA-producing species, in particular in grapes and derivatives from Mediterranean regions. In this work, highly efficient quantitative PCR assays using SYBR Green I and TaqMan methods were developed for specific detection of A. carbonarius to be used in grapes. The primers and the TaqMan probe were based on the internal transcribed region 2 multicopy region (internal 2 sequence of the rRNA gene). The specificity and sensitivity of both assays were tested on genomic DNA mixtures of several A. carbonarius strains and other fungal species frequently present in grapes. Both methods were also compared using grapes inoculated with different spore concentrations of A. carbonarius, detecting up to 0.4 pg DNA g(-1) grape berries. The efficiency and sensitivity of both methods were comparable and only the lower cost of SYBR Green might favour its use in routine screenings.
