[Diagnosis of non dermatophyte onychomycosis ant its relevance for treatment].
PCR methods are reliable and suitable to in situ identify dermatophytes, yeasts and non dermatophyte moulds (NDM) in onychomycosis. Onychomycosis insensitive to standard treatment with topical agents as well as with oral terbinafine or itraconazole revealed Fusarium spp., Acremonium spp. and Aspergillus spp. as infectious agents. However, NDM onychomycosis could be efficiently cured using topical amphotericin B. In conclusion, correct fungal species identification is important in onychomycoses in order to prescribe adequate treatments since dermatophytes and moulds have different sensitivities to antifungal drugs.
