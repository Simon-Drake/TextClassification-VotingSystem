Allocation of random amplified polymorphic DNA markers and enzyme activities to Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus tetrazonus chromosomes.
Chromosome-substituted haploid segregants of an A. nidulans x A. tetrazonus somatic hybrid were used to allocate several random amplified polymorphic DNA and isoenzyme markers to parental chromosomes. Twenty-six amplified DNA fragments, and nine isoenzyme activities, including lactate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, and arylesterase isoenzymes were assigned to chromosomes. Chromosomes-specific markers were found for each A. nidulans and A. tetrazonus chromosome. These markers could be used to saturate the genetic map of A. nidulans. The formation of two secondary metabolites was also assigned to chromosomes III and VIII. Attempts were made to allocate extracellular enzyme activities to parental chromosomes, mostly without success, possibly because multiple enzyme forms located on different chromosomes could be responsible for the production of an enzyme activity.
