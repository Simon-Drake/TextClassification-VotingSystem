PCR detection of DNA specific for Aspergillus species in serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis.
We investigated the possible presence of DNA specific for Aspergillus species in serum samples of patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA) by the nested PCR method. Fourteen strains of fungi including 5 strains of Aspergillus species and 10 strains of common bacteria were used for examination of specificity and sensitivity of the nested PCR. Two sets of oligonucleotide primers were derived from the sequence of the variable regions V7 to V9 of the 18S rRNA genes of Aspergillus fumigatus. The specific fragment was amplified from five strains of Aspergillus species in the single and nested PCR but not from other microorganisms. Target DNA was detected by the nested PCR with as little as 50 fg of the extracted DNA of A. fumigatus. We investigated the detection of DNA specific for Aspergillus species in serum samples of a murine model of aspergillosis and 20 patients with IA. The specific fragment was detected by the nested PCR in 71% of serum samples of infected mice and 70% of serum samples of patients with IA, while galactomannan antigen was detected in 43 and 60% of samples, respectively. The high sensitivity and specificity of the nested PCR indicate that the assay can provide early diagnosis with sufficient accuracy to be clinically useful for immunocompromised patients with IA.
