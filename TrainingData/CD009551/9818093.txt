Aspergillus fumigatus strains recovered from immunocompromised patients (ICP): subtyping of strains by RAPD analysis.
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients (ICP) is the second most frequent opportunistic fungal infection. The causative organism includes 16 species of Aspergillus, of which A. fumigatus dominates the ubiquitous incidence of invasive or allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The definitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is difficult. We have analyzed 24 strains of A. fumigatus recovered from ICP using the RAPD technique. The profiles generated with the 20 primers tested were mostly unique. These results may have a profound impact on the management of aspergillosis, especially in the ICP.
