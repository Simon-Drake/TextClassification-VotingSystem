[Screening strains producing inulinase and cloning of inulinase gene].
A wild-type strain AF10 producing inulinase was screened from soil samples, the strain is identified to be a A. niger. A endoinulinase gene inuA1 from A. niger AF10 was wequenced and analyzed, after PCR amplification. The results shows inuA1 is 1551 bp in length without any intron and contains 4 potential N-glycosylation sites. The conservative sequence is WMNEPN from the N-terminus. The inuA1 was cloned to pUC118 and the recombinant vector pinuA1 was obtained and transformed into E. coli JM109. The recombinant JM109/inuA1 included inuA1 was obtained.
