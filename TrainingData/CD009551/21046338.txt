Re-identification of Aspergillus fumigatus sensu lato based on a new concept of species delimitation.
The species concept of Aspergillus fumigatus sensu stricto has recently been defined by polyphasic taxonomy. Based on the new concept of species delimitations, 146 worldwide strains of Aspergillus fumigatus sensu lato were re-identified. Of those 146 strains, 140 (95.8%) could be identified as A. fumigatus sensu stricto, 3 (2.1%) as A. lentulus, and the remaining 3 strains as A. viridinutans complex, Neosartorya udagawae, and N. cf. nishimurae. Of 98 clinical strains, only 1 from dolphin nostril was identified as A. lentulus and not A. fumigatus sensu stricto. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) with primers PELF and URP1F produced nearly the same band patterns among 136 strains of A. fumigatus sensu stricto while discriminated the species from its related species. We also discussed about identification of several atypical A. fumigatus strains from clinical environments.
