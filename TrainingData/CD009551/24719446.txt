Simple, low-cost molecular assays for TR34/L98H mutations in the cyp51A gene for rapid detection of triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus isolates.
Simple, low-cost PCR/PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays targeting cyp51A promoter and codon 98 regions were developed for the detection of triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus strains carrying TR34/L98H mutations. The assays were evaluated using 40 itraconazole-susceptible isolates and 35 itraconazole-resistant isolates. The prevalence of TR34/L98H mutations in clinical/environmental A. fumigatus isolates may now be determined easily from resource-poor settings.
