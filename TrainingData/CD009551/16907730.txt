Cloning, sequence analysis and heterologous expression of the Myrothecium gramineum orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase gene.
A 2918 bp sequence coding for the orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase enzyme (OMPD) was isolated from the genome of Myrothecium gramineum. This sequence was analysed and, remarkably, it is the first OMPD gene of a Sordariomycete that has an intron. The gene codes for an enzyme of 282 amino acids. The nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence were compared with fungal OMPD sequences. They show the highest similarity to OMPD genes and enzymes of Aspergillus sp., Penicillium sp. and Cladosporium fulvum. The functionality of the gene as a selection marker was proven by complementation of the uracil auxotrophy of Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A722.
