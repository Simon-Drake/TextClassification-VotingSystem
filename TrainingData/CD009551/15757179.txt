The isoepoxydon dehydrogenase gene of patulin biosynthesis in cultures and secondary metabolites as candidate PCR inhibitors.
The European Union (EU) has introduced statutory limits for patulin in fruit products. Species definitions need to be unambiguous for this capability, especially to determine 'weak spots' in food, drink and feed production. Fungi were analysed for the isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (IDH) gene of the patulin metabolic pathway to indicate potential patulin production. In several cases inhibition of PCR product formation was indicated. Dilution as a means of overcoming PCR inhibition and to determine optimal concentrations was assessed and the ramifications for nucleic acid analysis in general are highlighted. The inhibitors may be secondary metabolites. However, inhibition was not involved obviously for Penicillium brevicompactum. The gene was detected frequently from Aspergillus section Clavati and Penicillium subgenus Penicillium species. Some strains within certain species were negative for the gene. Detection of the gene product in Byssochlamys is reported.
