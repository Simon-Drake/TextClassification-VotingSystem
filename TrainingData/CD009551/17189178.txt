Identification of genes from Aspergillus oryzae that are preferentially expressed in membrane-surface liquid culture.
We identified 22 genes from Aspergillus oryzae that are preferentially expressed in membrane-surface liquid culture (MSLC), among which Ser/Thr protein kinase (aopk1) and phosphatase (aoppt) genes were cloned. We also revealed that aopk1 encodes a protein with an N-terminal sequence 150 amino acid residues longer than that predicted from the registered sequence in GenBank.
