Biofouling on the walls of a spent nuclear fuel pool with radioactive ultrapure water.
Microbial activity in spent nuclear fuel pools which contain ultrapure and radioactive water has been previously observed. The aim of the present research was to isolate and identify the microorganisms attached to the nuclear pool wall of a Spanish nuclear power plant. Amplification of 16S rDNA fragments from the culturable microorganisms by PCR using universal primers for the domain 'Bacteria', followed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis analysis revealed the presence of six different bacteria. The complete gene for 16S rDNA of each one was sequenced and identified as belonging to three different phylogenetic groups, viz. beta-Proteobacteria, Actinomycetales and the Bacillus/Staphylococcus group. A fungus was also found and identified as Aspergillus fumigatus by sequencing the D2 region of the large subunit rDNA gene. The isolation of these microorganisms in oligotrophic and radioactive conditions is of great interest due to the possibility of their use in bioremediation processes of radionuclide-contaminated environments.
