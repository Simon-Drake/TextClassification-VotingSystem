Galactomannan and polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of primary digestive aspergillosis in a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia.
Primary intestinal invasive aspergillosis is rarely reported in leukaemic patients. We describe a case of jejunal invasive aspergillosis in the setting of aplasia following chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia. The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy obtained during surgery and our polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirmed Aspergillus flavus as the fungus responsible. This patient had high levels of circulating galactomannan, an antigen secreted by Aspergillus sp., in serum. The ELISA test for galactomannan has been developed to improve the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis but presents a 5-15% false positive rate. We suggest that some false positive results might be due to non-respiratory invasive aspergillosis, the usual localization of invasive aspergillosis. Our PCR test was also positive in serum. In case of positive results in serum with antigen and/or PCR tests without respiratory symptoms, the intestinal localizations should be investigated.
