[Current development in the diagnostics and therapy of systemic fungal infections in cancer patients].
Invasive fungal infections are associated with a high morbidity and mortality. They are of growing concern and a severe infectious complication in cancer patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. Within the last five years substantial progress has been demonstrated for non-culture based diagnostics and treatment of invasive fungal infections. Recent developments in the epidemiology, diagnostics and treatment of fungal infections are reviewed and discussed in the context of the current state of art for the management of invasive fungal infections in cancer patients.
