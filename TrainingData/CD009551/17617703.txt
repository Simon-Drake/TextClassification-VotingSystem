The glucoamylase-encoding gene (glaB) is expressed in solid-state culture with a low water content.
Solid-state culture encourages high-level enzyme secretion by Aspergillus oryzae. Using the real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we confirmed that expression of the glucoamylase-encoding gene in A. oryzae cultured in solid-state culture depends on the water content of the culture.
