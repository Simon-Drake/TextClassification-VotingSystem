[Non-modified magnetic beads coupled with multiple real-time PCR for detection and quantification of mycotoxigenic fungi in paprika samples].
OBJECTIVE: To establish a method for detecting 3 common toxigenic molds (Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium) based on non-modified magnetic beads coupled with multiple real-time PCR (NMB-multiple qPCR). METHODS: The primers and genus-specific probes were designed based on the rDNA sequences to develop a multiple real-time PCR using non-modified magnetic bead to enrichment of fungal spores. The sensitivity, specificity and repeatability of this assay were evaluated. RESULTS: The detection limit of this assay for spiked samples was 10(4) CFU/g, demonstrating a 10-fold greater detection sensitivity of this assay than that of real-time PCR. The NMB-multiple qPCR assay also showed good specificity and reproducibility and yielded comparable results with those by traditional colony counting method for spiked samples (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: NMB-multiple qPCR assay we established allows rapid and sensitive detection of common mycotoxigenic fungi in paprika.
