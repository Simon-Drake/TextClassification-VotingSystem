Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in a patient with cystic fibrosis: diagnostic criteria when the IgE level is less than 500 IU/mL.
BACKGROUND: Recently, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation developed a consensus report recommending diagnostic criteria for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis that includes a serum IgE level greater than 500 IU/mL as the "minimal diagnostic criterion." OBJECTIVE: To describe a 7-year-old girl with ABPA whose serum IgE level increased to only 398 IU/mL. METHODS: Total IgE and anti-Aspergillus serologic measurements were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and standard laboratory techniques; HLA analysis was performed; interleukin 4 receptor alpha single nucleotide polymorphisms were performed using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing; CD23+ B cells were measured using flow cytometry; and cytokine synthesis to Aspergillus purified antigens was assessed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: A 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis who had mild pulmonary disease and well-controlled asthma developed pulmonary infiltrates, increased wheezing, and decreased pulmonary function. Additional studies demonstrated peripheral blood eosinophilia (eosinophil count, 1807 cells/mm3 [19%]) and an increase in IgE and IgG anti-Aspergillus serology; bronchoalveolar lavage revealed septate hyphae with 45 degrees branching subsequently identified as A fumigatus and pulmonary eosinophilia. Previous HLA typing revealed that the patient was HLA-DR2+, DRB*1501, HLA-DQ2-, a pattern associated with increased risk of ABPA. In addition, there was increased up-regulation of CD23 molecules by interleukin 4 stimulation on the patient's B cells, as observed in ABPA. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and itraconazole with resolution of symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of the pulmonary inflammatory response using bronchoalveolar lavage, genetic risk with HLA-DR2+DQ2- typing, and increased interleukin 4 sensitivity are useful adjunctive studies in the diagnosis of ABPA.
