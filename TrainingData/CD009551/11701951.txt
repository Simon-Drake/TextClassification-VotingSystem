Identification and assignment of the human NIMA-related protein kinase 7 gene (NEK7) to human chromosome 1q31.3.
Neks (NIMA-related kinase) are a group of protein kinases sharing high amino acid sequence identity with NIMA which controls initiation of mitosis in Aspergillus nidulans. We have identified and characterized human NEK7, a novel human gene structurally related to NIMA. Its open reading frame encodes a 302-amino acid protein and is 77% identical to human NEK6 protein. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that NEK6, NEK7, and Caenorhabditis elegans F19H6.1 constitute a subfamily within the NIMA family of protein kinases. Tissue distributions of NEK7 and NEK6 were studied by RT-PCR. NEK7 expression was restricted to a subset of tissues containing lung, muscle, testis, brain, heart, liver, leukocyte, and spleen, but NEK6 transcripts were detected in all tissues studied. The human NEK7 gene was assigned to human chromosome 1 by somatic cell hybrids and 1q31.3 by radiation hybrid mapping.
