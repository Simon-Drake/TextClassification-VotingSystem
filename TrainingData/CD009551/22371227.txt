XlnR-independent signaling pathway regulates both cellulase and xylanase genes in response to cellobiose in Aspergillus aculeatus.
The expression levels of the cellulase and xylanase genes between the host strain and an xlnR disruptant were compared by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) to identify the genes controlled by XlnR-independent signaling pathway. The cellulose induction of the FI-carboxymethyl cellulase (cmc1) and FIb-xylanase (xynIb) genes was controlled by XlnR; in contrast, the cellulose induction of the FIII-avicelase (cbhI), FII-carboxymethyl cellulase (cmc2), and FIa-xylanase (xynIa) genes was controlled by an XlnR-independent signaling pathway. To gain deeper insight into the XlnR-independent signaling pathway, the expression profile of cbhI was analyzed as a representative target gene. Cellobiose together with 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), a glucosidase inhibitor, induced cbhI the most efficiently among disaccharides composed of beta-glucosidic bonds. Furthermore, cellobiose with DNJ induced the transcription of cmc2 and xynIa, whereas cmc1 and xynIb were not induced. GUS reporter fusion analyses of truncated and mutated cbhI promoters revealed that three regions were necessary for effective cellulose-induced transcription, all of which contained the conserved sequence 5'-CCGN(2)CCN(7)G(C/A)-3' within the CeRE, which has been identified as the upstream activating element essential for expression of eglA in A. nidulans (Endo et al. 2008). The data therefore delineate a pathway in which A. aculeatus perceives the presence of cellobiose, thereby activating a signaling pathway that drives cellulase and hemicellulase gene expression under the control of the XlnR-independent regulation through CeRE.
