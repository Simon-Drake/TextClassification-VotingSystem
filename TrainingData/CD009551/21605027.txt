Meningoencephalitis with Aspergillus and mycobacterium tuberculosis in a renal transplant recipient.
OBJECTIVES: We report a case of central nervous system coinfection with 2 types of opportunistic organisms-Aspergillus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-in a 33-year-old woman who underwent a renal transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: She developed a high-grade fever and right-sided weakness 1 month after the transplant while on mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone, and cyclosporine. RESULTS: Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple mass lesions with peripheral ring enhancement. Colony-stimulating factor polymerase chain reaction was positive for Aspergillus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Broad-spectrum antibiotics, antituberculous agents, and amphotericin were started. Unfortunately, the woman's condition deteriorated, and she died 2 weeks after admission to the hospital.
