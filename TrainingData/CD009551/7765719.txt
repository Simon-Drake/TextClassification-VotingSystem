Isolation of a chitin synthase gene (chsC) of Aspergillus nidulans.
We isolated a class I chitin synthase gene (chsC) from Aspergillus nidulans. Expression of this gene was confirmed by Northern analysis and by sequencing of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments from cDNA. chsC disruptants showed no difference of morphology in the asexual cycle and no difference of growth rate compared to a wild-type strain.
