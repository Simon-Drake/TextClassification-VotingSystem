Diagnostic value of DNA, (1-3)-beta-d-glucan, and galactomannan detection in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage of mice experimentally infected with Aspergillus terreus.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of Aspergillus terreus-specific DNA, (1-3)-beta-d-glucan (BDG), and galactomannan (GM) in immunosuppressed mice infected intravenously with A. terreus conidia and sacrificed in groups of 12 each on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. A. terreus-specific DNA, BDG, and GM in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), Fungitell kit (Associates of Cape Cod, E. Falmouth, MA), and Aspergillus Platelia kit (Bio-Rad, Marnes-laCoquette, France), respectively. Cultures of lung homogenate of all the animals yielded A. terreus. The BDG positivity, GM positivity, and nPCR positivity in serum specimens were 43%, 78%, and 73%, respectively. Combined detection enhanced the positivity to 95% for A. terreus DNA and GM, 83% for GM and BDG, and 95% for DNA, GM, and BDG. In BAL, the GM positivity and nPCR positivity were 80% and 81%, respectively, whereas combined detection increased the positivity to 98%. Detection of GM and DNA offers a sensitive and specific diagnostic option for invasive aspergillosis.
