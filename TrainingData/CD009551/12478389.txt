A Blumeria graminisf.sp. hordei BAC library--contig building and microsynteny studies.
A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei, containing 12,000 clones with an average insert size of 41 kb, was constructed. The library represents about three genome equivalents and BAC-end sequencing showed a high content of repetitive sequences, making contig-building difficult. To identify overlapping clones, several strategies were used: colony hybridisation, PCR screening, fingerprinting techniques and the use of single-copy expressed sequence tags. The latter proved to be the most efficient method for identification of overlapping clones. Two contigs, at or close to avirulence loci, were constructed. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed from BAC-end sequences to link the contigs to the genetic maps. Two other BAC contigs were used to study microsynteny between B. graminis and two other ascomycetes, Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus fumigatus. The library provides an invaluable tool for the isolation of avirulence genes from B. graminis and for the study of gene synteny between this fungus and other fungi.
