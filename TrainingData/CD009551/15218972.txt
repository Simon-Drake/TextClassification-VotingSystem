Successful micafungin (FK463) treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a phase II study.
We treated a 52-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) as a result of neutropenia following remission-induction chemotherapy. Although serological test results, such as those for platelia and pastrex, were all negative and the serum level of beta-D-glucan was low, Aspergillus DNA was detected in blood by the polymerase chain reaction method. A clinically documented diagnosis of IPA was made on the basis of chest x-rays, computed tomography scan findings, and the detection of Aspergillus DNA. Micafungin (FK463), a candin class antifungal agent, was administered at a dose of 75 to 150 mg/day, because other antifungal agents were not effective. The increase in serum concentration of micafungin was dose-dependent and was accompanied by improvement of symptoms and objective findings. Micafungin was effective for the treatment of IPA in this patient with ALL.
