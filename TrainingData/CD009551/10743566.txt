Directed deletions in the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene homolog cluster of Aspergillus oryzae.
To investigate the structure of the aflatoxin gene cluster in Aspergillus oryzae, 39 strains belonging to this species were examined for the existence of pksA, fas1A, aflR and vbs, and the results compared with those for ver-1 obtained previously. These five genes are involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus parasiticus. The strains examined were categorized into three groups; group 1, having the five homologs; 2, having ver-1 and vbs; and 3, having vbs homologs. Long-PCR analysis of the regions between the five homologs in A. oryzae IFO 4135, coupled with Southern-hybridization analysis, shows that those homologs are clustered with the same arrangement as in A. parasiticus. These results suggest that directed deletions of the cluster occur in A. oryzae strains. The possible breakpoints of the deletions in the strains of group 2 and 3 were estimated.
