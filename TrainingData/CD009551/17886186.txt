Detection of Aspergillus carbonarius and other black aspergilli from grapes by DNA OLISA microarray.
Black aspergilli, and particularly Aspergillus carbonarius, are responsible for ochratoxin A production in grapes. Correct identification of these species is essential for toxicological risk assessment in grape and wine. A low-complexity oligonucleotide microarray (OLISA, Apibio, F) based on DNA oligonucleotides probes, obtained from sequences of the calmodulin gene, was set up in order to detect A. carbonarius, A. japonicus/A. aculeatus and A. ibericus isolated from grape. The designed microarray distinguished all Aspergillus species and the detection limit for A. carbonarius was 3.2 pg of DNA as a template for the PCR reaction. This microarray offers a quick and parallel analysis to detect individual Aspergillus species in pure cultures and in naturally contaminated grape samples.
