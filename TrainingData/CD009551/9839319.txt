Molecular methods for epidemiological and diagnostic studies of fungal infections.
Over the past two decades there has been a remarkable increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections. Molecular methods, such as karyotyping, restriction analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have now been applied to improve our current understanding of the epidemiology of these fungal infections. For example, investigations on nosocomial outbreaks of fungal infections have been greatly facilitated by molecular methods. In addition, the ability to diagnose and identify deep-seated mycoses may be enhanced by the use of molecular techniques. In the near future it is possible that PCR-based methods will supplement, or perhaps even replace, traditional methods for detection of Candida albicans blood stream infections, invasive aspergillosis and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. This review examines the progress of molecular biology into the clinical arena of fungal epidemiology, laboratory identification and diagnosis.
