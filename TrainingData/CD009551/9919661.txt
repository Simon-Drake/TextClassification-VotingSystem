Isolation of csm1 encoding a class V chitin synthase with a myosin motor-like domain from the rice blast fungus, Pyricularia oryzae.
A gene encoding a chitin synthase with a myosin motor-like domain (csm1) was isolated from Pyricularia oryzae using a PCR fragment amplified from a fungal chitin synthase conserved region. The deduced amino acid sequence of csm1 is homologous to that of CsmA of Aspergillus nidulans (65% identity). The putative gene product of csm1 is consisted of the myosin motor-like domain and a chitin synthase domain as in A. nidulans csmA. The chitin synthase domain of its C-terminus was also homologous to Aspergillus fumigatus ChsE (61.4% identity) and Ustilago maydis Chs6 (48.6% identity) that encode class V chitin synthases. Northern analysis demonstrated that the csm1 was expressed throughout the mycelial growth of P. oryzae. This is the first report on the isolation of the gene encoding a class V chitin synthase with the myosin motor-like domain from P. oryzae.
