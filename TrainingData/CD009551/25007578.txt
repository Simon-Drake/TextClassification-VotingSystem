[Gene cloning, expression of a feruloyl esterase A and purification of its hydrolysis products].
To express feruloyl esterase A from Aspergillus oryzae in Pichia pastoris expression system and study its hydrolysis function, explore the conditions and effects of purification for ferulic acid extracts by macroporos resin. Using the total RNA from A. oryzae CICC 40186 as the template, we amplified coding sequence AorfaeA encoding a mature feruloyl esterase A (AorFaeA) by RT-PCR technique. Then, the coding sequence AorfaeA was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 mediated by an expression plasmid pPIC9K. The purified recombinant AorFaeA (reAorFaeA) showed one single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight of 39.0 kDa. The maximum activity of reAorFaeA to methyl ferulate, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), was 58.35 U/mg. Then, reAorFaeA was used to release ferulic acid from de-starched wheat bran in the presence of xylanase. The purification tests for ferulic acid from the enzymatic hydrolysate were carried out with preselected macroporous resins. The results showed that macroporous resin HPD-300 had much higher adsorption and desorption capacities. Ferulic acid could be quantitatively recovered by 50% of the eluent concentration at a flow speed of 1 mL/min. Under the purification condition, the recovery ratio of ferulic acid was 92%, and the content of ferulic acid was increased from 0.13% in the raw material to 10.55%. This work exploits the breakdown of ferulic acid by recombinant enzymeand provids a good strategy to its "green production".
