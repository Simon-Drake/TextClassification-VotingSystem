Characterization of two putative histone deacetylase genes from Aspergillus nidulans.
In eukaryotic organisms, acetylation of core histones plays a key role in the regulation of transcription. Multiple histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) maintain a dynamic equilibrium of histone acetylation. The latter form a highly conserved protein family in many eukaryotic species. In this paper, we report the cloning and sequencing of two putative histone deacetylase genes (rpdA, hosA) of Aspergillus nidulans, which are the first to be analyzed from filamentous fungi. Hybridization with a chromosome-specific cosmid library of A. nidulans allowed the localization of rpdA to chromosome III and hosA to chromosome II, respectively. PCR analyses and Southern hybridization experiments revealed that no further members of the RPD3 family are present in the genome of the fungus. Although sequence alignment displays significant amino acid similarity to other eukaryotic RPD3-type deacetylases, the deduced RPDA sequence reveals an unusual 200-amino acid extension at the C-terminus. Expression of both genes was determined by RNA blot analysis. Treatment of the cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a potent inhibitor of HDACs, was found to stimulate expression of rpdA of A. nidulans.
