Development of a nested qualitative real-time PCR assay to detect Aspergillus species DNA in clinical specimens.
We adapted a nested Aspergillus PCR to a nested qualitative real-time format on a Light Cycler system. An evaluation using 134 clinical specimens showed that the real-time PCR assay significantly reduced the time for results to be made available without compromising sensitivity and was less labor-intensive. Its use will aid in the rapid diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.
