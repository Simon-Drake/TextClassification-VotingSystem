Dectin-2 is predominately macrophage restricted and exhibits conspicuous expression during Aspergillus fumigatus invasion in human lung.
We investigated the features of Dectin-2 expression both at transcriptional and translational levels during Aspergillus fumigatus infection in human lung. Simultaneously, the expression of CD206 was assayed as an activated marker of alveolar macrophages. The characteristic of Dectin-2 expression were then confirmed in Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after A. fumigatus stimulation by Flow Cytometry. We found that the expression of Dectin-2 was low in normal lung, while it revealed a markedly up-regulation during A. fumigatus invasion. Dectin-2 expression was predominantly restricted to CD206 positive cells. There was salient positive correlation between Dectin-2 expression and CD206. We conclude that Dectin-2 expression is largely restricted to alveolar macrophages in human lung. The conspicuous expression of Dectin-2 during A. fumigatus invasion suggests its notable contribution to antifungal defenses in pulmonary aspergillosis.
