A point mutation in the 14alpha-sterol demethylase gene cyp51A contributes to itraconazole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus.
The genes encoding 14alpha-sterol demethylases (cyp51A and cyp51B) were analyzed in 12 itraconazole (ITC)-resistant and three ITC-susceptible clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus. Six ITC-resistant strains exhibited a substitution of another amino acid for glycine at position 54, which is located at a very conserved region of the Cyp51A protein. The cyp51A gene from the A. fumigatus wild-type strain (CM-237) was replaced with the mutated cyp51A gene copy of an ITC-resistant strain (AF-72). Two transformants exhibited resistance to ITC, both of which had incorporated the mutated copy of the cyp51A gene.
