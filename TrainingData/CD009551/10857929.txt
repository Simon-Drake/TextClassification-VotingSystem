The use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for monitoring aflatoxin production in Aspergillus parasiticus 439.
A detection system based on reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) has been developed to monitor aflatoxin gene expression in Aspergillus parasiticus. Total RNAs of aflatoxigenic A. parasiticus 439 grown in aflatoxin permissive and non-permissive media were amplified and monitored over time by RT-PCR with specific primers designed from two genes of the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway. Gene transcription in both media was assessed by monitoring the house keeping beta-tubulin gene and aflatoxin production was correlated with transcription by thin layer chromatography. This RT-PCR technique has the potential to be employed as a tool to investigate the effects of a variety of physiological factors on the transcription of the aflatoxin genes.
