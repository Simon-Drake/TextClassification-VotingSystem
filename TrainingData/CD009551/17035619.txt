Serial Aspergillus antigen monitoring in pediatric bone marrow transplant patients.
Invasive aspergillosis carries a high mortality rate in immunocompromised patients, such as bone marrow transplant patients. Favorable outcomes are dependent on early detection and treatment. Positive galactomannan antigenemia has been included as a microbiological criterion for probable or possible diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Detection of circulating Aspergillus DNA in the first positive galactomannan sample, with serial monitoring, could help in diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in bone marrow transplant patients. Morbidity and mortality from aspergillosis can possibly be reduced if an early diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment initiated. An effective and accurate way of early detection of invasive aspergillosis is serial Aspergillus antigen monitoring.
