Invasive fungal infections: biomarkers and molecular approaches to diagnosis.
The biomarkers galactomannan and 1,3-beta-d-glucan have been well studied over the past years and are gaining a role in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. Although not as well studied until recently, molecular methods for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection are also being evaluated. Outcomes data for molecular testing are expanding, but have not yet provided enough evidence for inclusion of molecular diagnostics in formal clinical guidelines. Lack of standardization and validation of the various molecular assays and platforms has hindered their widespread acceptance in the evaluation of invasive fungal infections, although the future is promising.
