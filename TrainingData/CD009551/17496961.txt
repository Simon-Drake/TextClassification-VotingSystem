Agrobacterium-mediated insertional mutagenesis of the ochratoxigenic fungus Aspergillus westerdijkiae.
Aspergillus westerdijkiae is a potent ochratoxin A (OTA) producer that has been found in coffee beans. OTA is known to have nephrotoxic effects and carcinogenic potential in animal species. Here we report for the first time the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for Aspergillus westerdijkiae and the generation of ochratoxin-defective mutants. Conidia were transformed to hygromycin B resistance using strain AGL-1 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The obtained transformation frequency was up to 47 transformants per 10(6) target conidia. Among 600 transformants, approximately 5% showed morphological variations. Eight transformants with consistently reduced OTA production were obtained. Two of these transformants did not produce OTA (detection limit: 0.1 microg/kg); the other six mutants produced lower amounts of OTA (1%-32%) compared with the wild-type strain. By using thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction, we successfully identified a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide monooxygenase gene.
