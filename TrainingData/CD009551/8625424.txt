The 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica de-represses on gluconeogenic substrates.
We have isolated the 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica by probing a genomic library with a PCR fragment amplified with primers deduced from two highly conserved regions of various PGKs. It is a unique sequence encoding a polypeptide of 417 residues with extensive homology to other PGKs, especially to that of Aspergillus nidulans (76% identity). The expression of the Y. lipolytica PGK1 gene proved to be higher on gluconeogenic substrates than on glycolytic ones. Haploid strains harboring a disrupted allele were able to grow on mixtures of a gluconeogenic carbon source and of a glycolytic one, but required proline supplementation in the presence of glucose, and were inhibited by glycerol.
