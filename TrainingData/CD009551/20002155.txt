Diagnostic challenges and recent advances in the early management of invasive fungal infections.
During the past 20 yr, the population of immunocompromized patients at risk of developing invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased, and there has been a shift in fungal epidemiology, with more infections caused by non-Aspergillus molds and yeasts, which are often resistant to one or more antifungal drugs. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as culture and the histopathology of infected tissue, often fail to detect IFIs until the later stages. Furthermore, invasive diagnostic methods to obtain tissue may be contraindicated in severely ill patients; even when tissue is available, the morphology of several filamentous fungi is identical, or the cultures may fail to grow the pathogen. Recently developed non-invasive diagnostic techniques, such as tests for serum markers and polymerase chain reaction assays, may allow for earlier and more accurate diagnoses - crucial in the effort to reduce morbidity and the risk of mortality. This article reviews current approaches to diagnosis and treatment, focusing on how an early and accurate diagnosis can guide treatment and improve outcomes. Strategies for improving the management of IFIs also are discussed.
