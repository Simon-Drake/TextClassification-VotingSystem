Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised children.
UNLABELLED: Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious life-threatening complication in immunocompromised children. The commonest risk groups are children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, leukaemia, corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive therapy, chronic granulomatous disease and severe combined immunodeficiency as well as neonates. The clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and many organ systems can be involved. Diagnosis based on the clinical presentation alone is cumbersome. Innovative and sensitive laboratory test systems which detect fungal antigens or DNA in clinical specimens have been recently developed. Specific Aspergillus antibody detection using recombinant antigen technique has also been introduced. Although each individual technique has drawbacks, the combined use of culture with antigen and antibody ELISA as well as PCR should result in an earlier and more definitive diagnosis of IA in children presenting with clinical and/or radiological signs of aspergillosis. In high risk children these methods are valuable for serial screening and early detection of Aspergillus infection. The implementation of accurate diagnostic criteria and standardised diagnostic flow charts in children at risk will lead to a better outcome of IA in the future. CONCLUSION: definite, well-timed early diagnosis and sufficient therapy is elementary for a successful outcome of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised children. To date, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis remains a combination of clinical presentation, radiology and microbiological tests.
