Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by galactomannan antigenemia detection using an enzyme immunoassay.
Invasive aspergillosis is a serious and often fatal infection in patients who are neutropenic or have undergone solid organ or stem cell transplantation. Delayed diagnosis and therapy may lead to poor outcomes. Diagnosis may be facilitated by a test for galactomannan antigen detection using an enzyme immunoassay. Other rapid methods for diagnosis include (1-->3)-beta-D: -glucan determination and polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity and specificity of galactomannan antigenemia testing in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens are high in patients with hematological malignancy, neutropenia, and receipt of stem-cell transplants. False positivity can be seen with concomitant administration of some antibiotics and infection by fungi other than Aspergillus.
