[Study on the asexual sporulation of Aspergillus niger under blue light induction and analysis of its subtractive library].
The effect of blue light (BL) on the morphological development of Aspergillus niger was studied by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. Comparing with the darkness, BL was able to stimulate development of sporangiophore and conidiosphore, promote grownth of mycelium. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was conducted with tester cDNA which was from 39 to approximately 40h-old mycelium cultured under darkness and driver cDNA which was from mycelium illuminated for 3 to approximately 4h under BL after dark growth. Some cDNA bands were obtained by suppression PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with the subtractive cDNA. Positive bacterial clones were randomly picked and identified by colony PCR method. Through sequence alignments from GenBank, most of differential cDNA fragments were highly identical with some redox enzymes existing in mitochondria, and the quantitative measurement of these differential mRNA by real time RT-PCR indicated that relative expression of the identified gene fragments under BL induction was higher than that under darkness. Furthermore, the result suggested that some respiratory chain redox enzymes of mitochondria were involved in the photoresponse and consequently influence the metabolism. Among differential cDNA fragments two unkown sequences were found and their complete gene and gene function remained to be investigated.
