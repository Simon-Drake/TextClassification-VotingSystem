Detection of imported histoplasmosis in serum of HIV-infected patients using a real-time PCR-based assay.
A new real-time PCR-based assay was used for detecting DNA of Histoplasma capsulatum in serum samples collected from four HIV-infected patients with proven histoplasmosis. The assay targeted the ITS1 region of rDNA and its in vitro sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility were evaluated. The technique detected DNA of H. capsulatum in all of the HIV-infected patients with proven histoplasmosis (4/4, 100%). The PCR result was positive for seven of the ten (70%) samples studied. The assay's specificity was determined to be 100%, since the method was negative for 25 other serum samples (10 from patients with proven aspergillosis and 15 from healthy controls). The PCR assay is a new and promising diagnostic alternative and further investigation is warranted.
