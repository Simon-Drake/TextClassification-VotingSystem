[Detection of Candida albicans by nested PCR].
A nested PCR assay was developed for the diagnosis of Candida albicans infection. A segment of the C. albicans beta-tubulin gene was amplified in this assay that was sensitive with the detection limit of 10 fg DNA of C. albicans. This assay was found to be specific by obtaining the negative results with 13 organisms (5 other Candida, 2 Cryptococcus, 3 Aspergillus, Escherichia coli and others). Cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with C. albicans meningitis was analyzed and was found to be positive. These results suggest that this assay can be clinically useful because of its high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity.
