[Current approaches to diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infection in HSCT recipients].
Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a kind of the most severe complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), Candida and Aspergillus are common causes. Because of immunosuppressive therapy, ablative conditioning regimen, acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease, long-term treatment of broad-spectrum antibiotics and cytomegalovirus infection, IFI has increased in the past few years. Invasive mould infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients. Methods for early diagnosis of IFI include clinical and laboratory examinations, as well as characteristic radiography. Voriconazole is the first-line antifungal agent for prevention of IFI. Combination therapy of two antifungal compounds such as azoles or amphotericin B with echinocandins have shown a good effectiveness and may be a promising future strategy for antifungal treatment. In this review, the early diagnosis and treatment of IFI in HSCT recipients are summarized. As for early diagnosis of IFI, the laboratory diagnosis techniques such as GM test, G test and PCR techniques are discussed. As for prophylaxis and treatment of IFI, the prophylaxis treatment, empirical treatment, preemptive treatment, targeted treatment, combined treatment and immunologic treatment are discussed.
