Rust and downy mildew resistance in pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) mediated by heterologous expression of the afp gene from Aspergillus giganteus.
The cDNA encoding the antifungal protein AFP from the mould Aspergillus giganteus was introduced into two pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) genotypes by particle bombardment. Stable integration and expression of the afp gene was confirmed in two independent transgenic T0 plants and their progeny using Southern blot and RT-PCR analysis. In vitro infection of detached leaves and in vivo inoculation of whole plants with the basidomycete Puccinia substriata, the causal agent of rust disease, and the oomycete Sclerospora graminicola, causal agent of downy mildew, resulted in a significant reduction of disease symptoms in comparison to wild type control plants. The disease resistance of pearl millet was increased by up to 90% when infected with two diverse, economically important pathogens. This is the first report of genetic enhancement of Pennisetum glaucum against fungal infections.
