Fast and easy method for construction of plasmid vectors using modified quick-change mutagenesis.
Plasmid vector construction is an essential step for molecular microbiology yet often a time-consuming process. Manipulation of the fungal genome to express genes to activate secondary metabolite production often requires creation of plasmid constructs in a reiterative fashion. Here we introduce a modified Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis method that allows for rapid and accurate construction of fungal transformation vectors.
