A regulator gene for acetate utilisation from Neurospora crassa.
The Neurospora crassa homologue of the Aspergillus nidulans regulatory gene facB has been cloned. The gene encodes a putative transcriptional activator of 865 amino acids that contains a DNA-binding domain with a Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) binuclear cluster, a linker region and a leucine zipper-like heptad repeat. Two internal amino acid sequences are identical to peptide sequences determined from proteolytic fragments of a DNA-binding protein complex specific for genes involved in acetate utilisation and expressed in acetate-induced mycelia of N. crassa. Recombinant expression of the predicted DNA-binding domain demonstrates that it is capable of independent recognition of a subset of the promoter sequences that bind the protein complex from N. crassa. A duplication-induced mutation in the corresponding gene results in an acetate non-utilising phenotype that is characterised by inefficient induction of the enzymes required for acetate utilisation. The new gene does not fall into any existing complementation group and has been designated acu-15.
