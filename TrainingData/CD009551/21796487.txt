The role of sho1 in polarized growth of Aspergillus fumigatus.
Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen that may cause severe invasive disease in immunocompromised patients. The filamentous fungi undergo polarized growth, searching for nutrients in the environment and causing invasive growth in tissue. Sho1 is a sensor of the high osmolarity glycerol pathway, and the sho1 mutant showed a decrease in growth rate. We found that sho1 is involved in the polarized growth of A. fumigatus. The sho1 mutation resulted in extended isotropic growth of germinating conidia followed by multiple germ tubes and wide hyphae with short intercalary cells by calcofluor white staining. The mechanism by which sho1 gene affected polarized growth is investigated. A reduced number of apical vesicles with greater dispersion were observed by transmission electron microscopy in the Spitzenkorper body of the sho1 mutant. Actin patches were distributed randomly at low density at early stages of mutant strain fungal development and reaggregated to the hyphal tip of later stages when long filamentous fungi formed. Actin patches located at the tip of polarized wild-type cells. RNA levels of polarized growth-related genes Rho GTPases were detected by real-time PCR. The sho1 gene did not affect the RNA expression when strains were cultured at 37 degrees C for 6 h. At 17 h, the RNA expression of rho1, rho3 and CDC42 in the sho1 mutant were 0.18-, 0.18- and 0.33-fold of that in the wild type. The sho1 gene affected the polarized growth through affecting the expression of Rho GTPases, the distribution of actin cytoskeleton, vesicle quantity and distribution.
