Biodegradation of a mixture of PAHs by non-ligninolytic fungal strains isolated from crude oil-contaminated soil.
Nine native non-ligninolytic fungal strains were isolated from Maya crude oil-contaminated soil and selected based on their ability to grow and use crude oil and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as carbon source, for their application to PAH removal in soil. The fungi were identified by PCR amplification of intergenic transcribed sequences regions and microbiological techniques, and results showed them to be part of the genera Fusarium, Neurospora, Aspergillus, Scedosporium, Penicillium, Neosartorya and Talaromyces. A primary selection of fungi was made in minimal medium plates, considering the tolerance to different concentrations of PAHs for each strain. The radial extension rate exhibited significant differences (p < 0.05) from 200 to 1,000 mg of PAHs mixture l(-)(1). A secondary selection of Aspergillus terreus, Talaromyces spectabilis, and Fusarium sp. was achieved based on their tolerance to 2,000 mg of a mixture of Phenanathrene and Pyrene kg(-)(1) of soil in a solid-state microcosm system for 2 weeks. The percentage of PAH removal obtained by the three strains was approximately 21 % of the mixture.
