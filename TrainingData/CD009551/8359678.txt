Structural features of a polygalacturonase gene cloned from Aspergillus oryzae KBN616.
A genomic gene encoding a polygalacturonase from Aspergillus oryzae, used in soy sauce production, was cloned and sequenced. The structural gene comprises 1227 bp coding for 363 amino acids with a putative prepropeptide of 28 amino acids and the open reading frame is disrupted by two short introns of 57 bp and 81 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein showed 63, 63, 63 and 64% homology with those of Aspergillus niger polygalacturonase I, Aspergillus niger polygalacturonase II, Aspergillus tubingensis polygalacturonase II and Cochliobolus carbonum polygalacturonase, respectively. There is, however, little homology among fungal, plant and bacterial polygalacturonases.
