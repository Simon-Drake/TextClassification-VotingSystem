Distribution of ochratoxin A producing strains in the A. niger aggregate.
Ochratoxin A (OA) production of 92 isolates belonging to the A. niger aggregate was tested. All these isolates were grouped into the two proposed species A. niger and A. tubingensis, according to their ITS-5.8S rDNA RFLP patterns. The distribution of the isolates into the two species was very similar since 52.2% were classified as pattern T (corresponding to A. tubingensis), and 47.8% were classified as pattern N (corresponding to A. niger). Six out of the 92 isolates studied produced OA. All the OA producing strains were classified as pattern N while none of the isolates classified as pattern T produced OA.
