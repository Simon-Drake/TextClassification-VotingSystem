[Acute respiratory failure in a 16-yr-old girl with alveolar soft part sarcoma].
BACKGROUND: Intensive treatment in oncology often leads to severe complications, including infection and coagulation disturbances. Among the most serious are fungal infections which are often life-threatening, and difficult to recognize and treat. We present a patient with severe pneumonia and pleural effusion, that developed during treatment of a soft tissue sarcoma with pulmonary metastases. CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the ITU because of marked dyspnoea, bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was intubated and placed on a ventilator, and bilateral pleural drains were inserted. She also required vigorous inotropic support (dopamine + noradrenaline). CRP was 12.5-19.8 mg dL(-1) and procalcitonin was below 1 ng mL(-1)). Lung metastases and tuberculosis were excluded and fungal infection suspected. Aspergillus DNA was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage, and in blood serum (PCR). Amphotericin B and voriconazole were instituted, but without evident success, The girl was severely distressed, required mechanical ventilation with an F1O2 of 0.6, while her CRP increased to 28.4 mg dL(-1). The amphotericin was stopped and replaced with caspofungin, resulting in rapid improvement in her clinical status. The girl was extubated after 21 days of ventilation, however due to a very severe opioid withdrawal syndrome with extreme agitation, she was re-intubated. After a further two weeks on methadone and sedatives, she was extubated again, this time successfully, One month later she was discharged from the hospital, still on oral voriconazole. CONCLUSION: Fungal infection should always be considered in immunocompromised patients with clinical signs of systemic infection. Recognition and treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult and may require multi drug therapy.
