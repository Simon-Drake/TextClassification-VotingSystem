Cloning, structural organization and regulation of expression of the Penicillium chrysogenum paf gene encoding an abundantly secreted protein with antifungal activity.
An abundantly secreted, highly basic 12-kDa protein (PAF) was purified from the culture medium of Penicillium chrysogenum (Pc). Based on the N-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence of the protein, an oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe was derived and used for amplification of the encoding cDNA by PCR. This cDNA fragment encodes a Cys-rich preproprotein of 92 aa which appears to be processed to a mature product of 55 aa. The deduced aa sequence of the preproprotein reveals 42.6% identity to an antifungal protein (AFP) of Aspergillus giganteus. Agar diffusion tests confirmed that the Pc protein exhibits antifungal activity. In order to investigate the promoter region and the structural organization of the paf gene, a genomic 6-kb fragment was isolated and partially sequenced. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the genomic fragment and the cDNA clone revealed the presence of a coding region of 279 bp which is interrupted by two introns of 76 and 68 bp in length. In the promoter region, a typical TATA box, a motif resembling the fungal carbon catabolite repression element, as well as several putative GATA factor binding motifs, were found. Northern blot analysis indicated that the regulation of paf expression occurs at the level of mRNA transcription and is under control of carbon catabolite and nitrogen metabolite repression regulatory circuits.
