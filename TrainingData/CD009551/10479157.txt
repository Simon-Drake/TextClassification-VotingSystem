Proteases from Aspergillus fumigatus induce interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 production in airway epithelial cell lines by transcriptional mechanisms.
Proteases secreted by Aspergillus fumigatus induce the production of cytokines by epithelial cells, including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. In the present study, we focused on the mechanism(s) by which A. fumigatus-derived proteases elicit cytokine production in epithelial cells. In the epithelial cell line A549, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels were enhanced by proteases as a result of transcriptional induction of the respective genes. Transcriptional induction of both genes coincided with enhanced DNA binding of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and NF-IL6, whereas activator protein-1 was unlikely to be involved. The enhanced transcriptional activity could be inhibited by the addition of chymostatin, showing serine protease dependency. Posttranscriptional mechanisms affecting the stability of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNAs were not involved in protease-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production. These data show that after exposure to A. fumigatus-derived proteases, IL-6 and IL-8 gene expressions are up-regulated as a result of transcriptional mechanisms.
