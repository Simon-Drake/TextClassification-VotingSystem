Clinical utility of Aspergillus galactomannan and PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with haematological malignancies.
Interpretation of Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) and PCR results in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in patients with haematological malignancies requires clarification. A total of 116 patients underwent BAL for investigation of new lung infiltrates: 40% were neutropenic, 68% and 36% were receiving mould-active antifungal agents and beta-lactam antibiotics. The diagnosis of proven IPA (n = 3), probable IPA (n = 15), and possible invasive fungal disease (IFD, n = 50) was made without inclusion of GM results. BAL GM (at cut-off of 0.8) had lower diagnostic sensitivity for IPA than PCR (61% versus 78%) but higher specificity (93% versus 79%). Both tests had excellent negative predictive values (85-90%), supporting their utility in excluding IPA. The use of BAL GM and PCR results increased the certainty of Aspergillus aetiology in 7 probable IPA cases where fungal hyphae were detected in respiratory samples by microscopy, and upgraded 24 patients from possible IFD to probable IPA. Use of BAL GM and PCR improves the diagnosis of IPA.
