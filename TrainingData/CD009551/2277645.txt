Isolation and molecular analysis of the orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase gene (pyrG) of Phycomyces blakesleeanus.
The pyrG gene of Phycomyces was isolated from a Phycomyces genomic library, constructed in the cosmid pHS255, by hybridization with a 170 bp fragment of the pyrG gene of Aspergillus niger. This fragment includes a consensus sequence found in almost all species in which the orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (OMPdecase) gene has been sequenced. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cloned pyrG gene from Phycomyces was determined and the transcription start sites mapped. In the predicted amino acid sequence there are regions of strong homology to the equivalent genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, A. niger, Schizophyllum commune and Homo sapiens. Analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of two introns. The precise length and location of these introns was determined by sequencing the pyrG cDNA and comparing it with the genomic clone. Non-coding flanking regions showed obvious homology to the consensus TATA and CAAT boxes, and the polyadenylation signal "AATAAA". The pyrG gene is the second Phycomyces gene that has been cloned and analysed. This is the first time that introns have been reported in Phycomyces.
