Effects of aflastatin A, an inhibitor of aflatoxin production, on aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway and glucose metabolism in Aspergillus parasiticus.
Aflastatin A inhibits aflatoxin production by Aspergillus parasiticus via an unknown mechanism. We found that aflastatin A clearly inhibited production of norsolorinic acid, an early biosynthetic intermediate of aflatoxin, at a concentration of 0.25 microg/ml. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and real-time quantitative PCR (TaqMan PCR) experiments indicated that the transcription of genes encoding aflatoxin biosynthetic enzymes (pksA, ver-1, and omtA) and a gene encoding a regulatory protein for expression of the biosynthetic enzymes (aflR) were significantly reduced by the addition of aflastatin A. We also found that aflastatin A elevated the glucose consumption and ethanol accumulation by A. parasiticus, and repressed transcription of genes involved in ethanol utilization. These results suggest that aflastatin A inhibits a very early step in aflatoxin biosynthesis prior to the transcription of aflR and can influence glucose metabolism in the fungus.
