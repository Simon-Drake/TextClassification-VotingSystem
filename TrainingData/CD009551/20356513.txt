[The establishment and evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of AllGlo(TM) probe-based techniques for invasive aspergillosis.].
OBJECTIVE: To establish and evaluate a diagnostic technique based on the AllGlo(TM) probe for the invasive aspergillosis. METHODS: With the self-designed AllGlo(TM) probes and primers and the standards, two standard curves of the real-time PCR based on AllGlo(TM) probes were established respectively for A. flavus and A. fumigatus, then its specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility were evaluated respectively. RESULTS: The findings indicated that the standard curve of A. flavus was Y = -3.003X + 36.825, and A.fumigatus' was Y = -3.052X + 38.016, and their interassay coefficient of variation respectively were 15.60% and 12.94%, suggesting a good reproducibility. The lowest spore concentration they could be detected was 10 CFU/ml, which equated to 100 - 1000 copies of internal transcribed spacer (ITS)2 genes, suggesting a good sensibility. They didn't have cross-positive reaction with other fungus, human genome and bacteria, which indicated a good specificity. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic technique based on the AllGlo(TM) probe for the invasive aspergillosis possessed a good sensitivity, good specificity and deadly accuracy.
