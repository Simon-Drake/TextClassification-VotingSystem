Occurrence and quantification of fungi and detection of mycotoxigenic fungi in drinking water in Xiamen City, China.
Fungi are known to play an important role in nutrient and carbon cycling, and the occurrence of fungi in the water supply may result in a variety of human health problems. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and frequency of various fungi in drinking water over a one-year period. The study also aimed to quantify the fungal presence using real-time PCR, and to effectively detect mycotoxigenic fungi in a variety of water sources. Water samples were collected from different water systems (surface water, public system water, house water, and tank water), from different sites (n=15) in Xiamen, China. Each month from February 2011 to January 2012, 22 water samples were collected and analyzed. The results showed that surface water samples possessed a higher frequency of fungi than did the other water samples. Identification of fungal species was conducted using morphological and molecular methods. The most dominant fungi found were Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Pencillium spp., Trichoderma spp., Mucor sp., and Rhizopus sp. Notably, the more-frequency observed fungi in the tap water of houses and public systems were Fusarium sp., Exophiala sp., and Phialophora sp. Meanwhile, mycotoxigenic fungi were detected in some water samples at different times. The strains isolated from samples collected in September to November had the aflatoxigenic fungi, and for fumonisin and trichothecenes, the fungi strains were re-isolated from water in November and December.
