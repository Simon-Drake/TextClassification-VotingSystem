Detection of PCR-amplified fungal DNA by using a PCR-ELISA system.
In order to speed up and standardize polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of medically important fungi in clinical samples we established a combination of commercially available kits for DNA extraction, PCR amplification and detection of the amplicons. The PCR plate assay proved to be as sensitive and specific as our previously published assay (5 cfu ml(-1) blood). Moreover, in a selected group of patients, all patients with proven and probable invasive fungal infection were found to be PCR-positive. Thus the PCR plate assay was found to be a sensitive, technically simplified and standardized method with potential for adaptation to automation.
