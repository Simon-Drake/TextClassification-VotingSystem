[Evaluation of new method for diagnosis of opportunistic fungal infection].
New methods for the possible presence DNA specific for Aspergillus or Trichosporon species were developed. In aspergillus PCR, Aspergillus l8S rRNA encoding gene was amplified from five strains of Aspergillus species by the nested PCR but not from other microorganisms. Results of preliminary investigation of this method demonstrated efficient detections of Aspergillus species in serum samples of rats model of aspergillosis and 29 patients with invasive aspergillosis. In trichosporon PCR, Trichosporon 26S rRNA encoding gene was amplified from two strains of Trichosporon species, and detected by the nested PCR in 64 % of serum samples of patients with trichosporonosis, while glucuronoxylomannan antigen was detected in 55 % of samples. The high sensitivity and specificity of the nested PCR indicate that the assay can provide early diagnosis with sufficient accuracy to be clinically useful for patients with opportunistic fungal infection.
