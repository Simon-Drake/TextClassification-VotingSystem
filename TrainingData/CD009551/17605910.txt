[Experimental study of fast diagnosis of mycotic keratitis using molecular biology technical].
OBJECTIVE: To establish a method for fast diagnosis of mycotic keratitis using multi-PCR system. METHODS: Detecting 9 important medical fungi species (Fusarium solani, Fusarium moniliform, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium graminum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium implicatum and Curvularia lunata) through a multi-PCR system. This method was used to identify the clinical cultured isolates and clinical samples. RESULTS: In this multi-PCR system, Fusarium species amplified a fragment of 360 bp, Aspergillus species amplified a fragment of 430 bp, Penicillium implicatum species amplified a fragment of 245 bp, and Curvularia lunata species amplified a fragment of 300 bp. Human DNA and DNA of other microorganism in human ocular infection obtained negative results in this multi-PCR system. The sensitivity of the multi-PCR system was 10 fg. CONCLUSIONS: Important clinical fungi could be detected and identified by the multi-PCR system. The multi-PCR method was proved to be a fast, sensitive and specific technology and has a good prospect in clinical application.
