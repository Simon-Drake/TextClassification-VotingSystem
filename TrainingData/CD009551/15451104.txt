Development of a novel quadruple auxotrophic host transformation system by argB gene disruption using adeA gene and exploiting adenine auxotrophy in Aspergillus oryzae.
We previously designed a triple auxotrophic host-vector system in Aspergillus oryzae by isolating red-colored adenine auxotrophic mutants upon UV mutagenesis of a double auxotrophic host (niaD-sC-). In the present study an effort to exploit this system and construct a novel quadruple auxotrophic host was made by disrupting the argB gene involved in arginine biosynthesis. The argB gene-disruption cassette was generated by fusion PCR, which required only two steps of PCR to insert the selectable marker, adeA, into the target argB gene. The chimeric DNA fragment was transformed into the triple auxotrophic strain (niaD-sC-adeA-) and the argB disruptants were obtained with a high rate of efficiency (approximately 40%). The argB disruptants were characterized by normal colony color and reversal of arginine auxotrophy by introduction of the wild-type argB gene. Quadruple auxotrophic strains (niaD-sC-DeltaargB adeA- or niaD-sC-DeltaargB adeB-) were subsequently isolated upon UV mutagenesis of the triple auxotrophic strain (niaD-sC-DeltaargB) followed by screening of red-colored colonies for adenine auxotrophy. The results obtained showed that the adeA gene served as an efficient selection marker in developing a novel host-vector system with quadruple auxotrophy in A. oryzae, thus providing a powerful tool to breed multiple auxotrophic mutants from a deuteromycete wherein sexual crossing is impossible.
