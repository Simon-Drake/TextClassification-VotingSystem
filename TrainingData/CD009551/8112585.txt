Two novel deduced serine/threonine protein kinases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
We have cloned genes for two closely related protein kinase (PK) homologues from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sequence alignment of the kinase domain with previously characterized PK reveals the highest degree of similarity with second messenger-regulated kinases. RCK1 encodes a 58-kDa protein, and is weakly expressed. RCK2 encodes a 65-kDa protein, and transcripts from this gene are readily detected. RCK1 has been mapped to the L arm of chromosome VII, and RCK2 to chromosome XII. Disruption of these genes in the S. cerevisiae genome demonstrates that both genes are non-essential.
