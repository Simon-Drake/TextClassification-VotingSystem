Cloning, characterization, and expression of the gene encoding alkaline protease in the marine yeast Aureobasidium pullulans 10.
The alkaline protease structural gene (ALP1 gene) was isolated from both the genomic DNA and cDNA of Aureobasidium pullulans 10 by inverse PCR and RT-PCR. An open reading frame of 1248 bp encoding a 415 amino-acid protein with calculated molecular weight of 42.9 kDa was characterized. The gene contained two introns, which had 54 bp and 50 bp, respectively. The promoter of ALP1 gene was located from -62 to -112 and had two CCAAT boxes and one TATA box. The terminator of ALP1gene contained the sequence with a hairpin structure (AAAAAGTT TGGTTTTT). The protein sequence deduced from ALP1 gene exhibited 55.24%, 50.35%, and 31.68% identity with alkaline proteases from Aspergillus fumigatus, Acremonium chrysogenum, and Yarrowia lipolytica, respectively. The protein was found to have the conserved serine active site and histidine active site of serine proteases in the subtilisin family. The recombinant A. pullulans alkaline protease produced in Y. lipolytica formed clear zones on the double plates with 2% casein and alkaline protease activity in the supernatant of the recombinant Y. lipolytica culture was detected, suggesting that the cloned ALP1 gene is expressed in Y. lipolytica and the expressed alkaline protease is secreted into the medium.
