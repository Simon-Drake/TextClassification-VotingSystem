Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in a heart transplant recipient in Korea, with emphasis on microbial diagnosis.
Rhodococcus equi is an opportunistic pathogen that usually causes infection in immunocompromised hosts. A heart transplant recipient who had been treated with amphotericin B for pulmonary aspergillosis showed newly developed multiple nodules with a central necrotic area in the right lower lobes. Cultures of several blood samples and an aspirate of the lung nodule yielded a Gram-positive coccobacillary bacterium, which was initially reported as a Corynebacterium species, but was later identified as R. equi by API CORYNE (bioMerieux SA, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and by demonstrating the production of 'equi factor'. The identification was subsequently confirmed by an R. equi-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient was successfully treated with ciprofloxacin and azithromycin for 14 weeks. This is the first documented case of R. equi infection in Korea. There is a possibility of underestimation of R. equi infections due to the misidentification of the organism as a contaminating diphtheroid. Because R. equi will not respond to the conventional empirical therapy, the microbiology laboratory should identify R. equi in a timely manner. R. equi-specific PCR will be a useful confirmatory test in human infection.
