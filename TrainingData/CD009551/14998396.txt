Identification of medically important fungi by the Pyrosequencing technology.
The Pyrosequencing technology was used for identification of different clinically relevant fungi. The tests were performed on amplicons derived from the 18S rRNA gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) universal primers for amplification. Sequencing was performed up to 40 bases in a variable region with a designed general sequencing primer and the Pyrosequence data were analyzed by BLAST sequence search in the GenBank database. DNA from a total of 21 fungal specimens consisting of nine strains of clinically relevant fungi and 12 clinical specimens from patients suffering from proven invasive fungal infections were PCR-amplified and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the Pyrosequencing technology. All data obtained by the Pyrosequencing technology were in agreement with the results obtained by PCR-ELISA using species/genus-specific oligonucleotides and were as well in accordance with the culture results. The results demonstrate that the Pyrosequencing method is a reproducible and reliable technique for identification of fungal pathogens.
