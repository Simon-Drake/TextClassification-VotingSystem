PCR ITS-RFLP: A useful method for identifying filamentous fungi isolates on grapes.
Restriction digestion analysis of the ITS products was tested as an easy method to identify isolates of filamentous fungi on grapes. Endonucleases SduI, HinfI, MseI, HaeIII were used. Endonucleases BfmI, Cfr9I, Hpy188I, MaeII or PspGI were used as necessary to complete discrimination. The 43 species studied generated 42 different composite profiles. Only the species P. thomii and P. glabrum gave the same composite profile. 96.3% strains tested could be differentiated to the species level with only four enzymes. Hundred ninety nine strains of filamentous fungi were isolated from various vineyards in Burgundy and identified by this method. Penicillium (58.5%) was the genus the most frequently isolated and no strains of the genus Aspergillus was isolated. P. spinolusum was the most isolated species of Penicillium (22.70%). The species C. cladiosporioides, B. cinerea, E. nigrum, A. alternata, T. koningiopsis, P. diplodiella, C. herbarum, A. alternatum, T. cucumeris and F. oxysporum were also isolated. This technique is a rapid and reliable method appropriate for routine identification of filamentous fungi. This can be used to screen large numbers of isolates from various environments in a short time. This is the first exhaustive study of fungal diversity at species level in vineyard.
