Two primer pairs to detect OTA producers by PCR method.
Fungi contaminating foods and feeds may produce many mycotoxins including ochratoxin A (OTA). Early and rapid detection of potential OTA producing fungi is important to reduce the negative impacts of OTA. In this study, two PCR specific primer pairs, AoLC35-12L/AoLC35-12R and AoOTAL/AoOTAR, were designed from a DNA sequence of a polyketide synthase gene in Aspergillus ochraceus NRRL 3174. On 14 different fungi tested by PCR, AoLC35-12L/AoLC35-12R amplified a unique band from either OTA or citrinin producers while AoOTAL/AoOTAR amplified one PCR product only from A. ochraceus. So these primers could be used to detect both OTA and citrinin producing fungi (AoLC35-12L/AoLC35-12R) or only A. ochraceus (AoOTAL/AoOTAR) from foodstuffs using PCR method.
