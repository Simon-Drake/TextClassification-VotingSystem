Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding tannase and a structural study of the tannase subunit from Aspergillus oryzae.
We cloned the Aspergillus oryzae tannase gene using three oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) probes synthesized according to the tannase N-terminal and an internal amino acid (aa) sequence. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the tannase gene was determined and compared with that of a tannase DNA complementary to RNA (cDNA) by means of reverse transcriptase PCR. The results indicated that there was no intron in the tannase gene and that it coded for 588 aa with a molecular weight of about 64,000. The tannase low-producing strain A. oryzae AO1 was transformed with the plasmid pT1 which contained the tannase gene, and tannase activities of the transformants increased in proportion to the number of copies. Tannase consisted of two kinds of subunits, linked by a disulfide bond(s) with molecular weights of about 30,000 and 33,000, respectively. We purified these subunits and determined their N-terminal aa sequences. The large and small subunits of tannase were encoded by the first and second halves, respectively. Judging from the above results, the tannase gene product is translated as a single polypeptide that is cleaved by post-translational modification into two tannase subunits linked by a disulfide bond(s). We concluded that native tannase consisted of four pairs of the two subunits, forming a hetero-octamer with a molecular weight of about 300,000.
