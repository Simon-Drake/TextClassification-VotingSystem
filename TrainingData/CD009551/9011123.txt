[Detection of DNA specific for Aspergillus species in serum samples from two patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis].
We investigated the possible presence of DNA specific for Aspergillus species in serum samples of two patients who were strongly suspected for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Both patients were diagnosed as having acute myelogenous leukemia and treated with induction chemotherapy. During chemotherapy-induced granulocytopenia, they complained of high fever, and the chest X-rays indicated infiltration shadows in their lungs. They were treated with antibiotics intravenously, but no clinical improvement was observed. As the results of the nested PCR were positive at the acute stage of infection, amphotericin B i.v. and granulocyte colony stimulating factor s.c. administrations were started in both cases. In case 1, the infectious disease improved and the nested PCR results turned negative after treatment. In case 2, in spite of the progression of the disease, the nested PCR results turned negative during treatment. Although we consider this method very useful for the diagnosis of IPA, further prospective evaluation with a large clinical population sample is required.
