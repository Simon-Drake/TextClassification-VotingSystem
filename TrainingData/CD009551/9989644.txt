Value of different methods for the characterisation of Aspergillus terreus strains.
To evaluate different methods for strain differentiation, 10 isolates of Aspergillus terreus from Germany and two epidemiologically unrelated strains were investigated. The sources of the isolates were patients with cystic fibrosis (4), immunosuppression (2), otitis externa (2), sinusitis (1) and endocarditis (1). Environmental isolates were obtained from a contaminated cell culture and from soil. The isolates did not differ in their macroscopic and microscopic morphology, in their protein patterns analysed by SDS-PAGE and in their susceptibility to amphotericin B and itraconazole. The RFLP analysis of total genomic DNA digested by EcoRI resulted in patterns that were too faint for interpretation. However, after hybridisation of the digested DNA with a short DNA probe of repetitive sequence, six different patterns were found. Based on the patterns of the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) with three primers, nine different genotypes were discriminate. RAPD patterns discriminated the epidemiologically unrelated reference strains (endocarditis isolate from Thailand, soil isolate from the USA) and the isolates from Germany. It is concluded that, in contrast to the phenotypic methods, the analysis of RAPD patterns is useful for strain differentiation of A. terreus.
