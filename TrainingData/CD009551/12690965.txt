[Invasive aspergillosis: results of an 8-year study].
We analysed retrospectively 90 cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA) which occurred at the University Hospital and the Thoraxklinik gGmbH Heidelberg between 1991 and 1998. 71 cases were histologically proven, 19 were probable diseases. There were 49 male and 41 female patients, with a mean age of 51.5 years (range 16 days to 80 years). Underlying diseases were: hematological malignancies in 52% (n = 47; 24 with acute leukemia), solid organ transplantation (n = 11; 9 liver, 1 kidney, 1 heart), solid cancer (n = 10), others (n = 21), and in one case no underlying disease was diagnosed. Only 54 cases (60%) were correctly diagnosed as IA during lifetime of the patients. In 59 cases (65%) only the lung was affected, 25 patients suffered from disseminated IA, in 6 patients only extrapulmonary lesions were present. 11 patients underwent lung surgery, 63 patients received antimycotic drugs (44 amphotericin B, 15 fluconazole, 4 itraconazole), 21 were not treated antimycotically. 68 patients (71%) died, from these 30 (36%) due to IA during remission of the underlying disease. The laboratory methods showed the following sensitivities, respectively: microscopy by calcofluor white staining 17%, culture 69%, Aspergillus-PCR from respiratory tract samples and biopsies 95%, galactomannan antigen detection by latex agglutination 28%, by enzyme immunoassay 59%, Aspergillus antibody detection 23%.
