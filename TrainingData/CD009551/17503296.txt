Comparison of detection methods for Aspergillus fumigatus in environmental air samples in an occupational environment.
Methods to study occupational exposures to fungi and fungal materials in facilities where the dominant exposure is the pathogenic and allergenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus are lacking. Air samples were collected near a conveyor in a wood chip recycling plant to compare methods that might be used to assess exposure to A. fumigatus or suitable proxies. These included total dust mass, total intact spores, culturable propagules growing > 35 degrees C, ergosterol, A. fumigatus allergen Asp f1, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for A. fumigatus. Of these measurements, Asp f1 showed the most promise based on its relative response to measurements where there is a long history of use in industrial hygiene practice (total mass, ergosterol, total intact spores, culturable propagules).
