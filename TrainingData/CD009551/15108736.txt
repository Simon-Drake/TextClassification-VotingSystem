Rapid monitoring by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for pathogenic Aspergillus during carpet removal from a hospital.
Monitoring for pathogenic Aspergillus species using a rapid, highly sensitive, quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique during carpet removal in a burn unit provided data that allowed patients to be safely returned to the refloored area sooner than if only conventional culture monitoring had been used.
