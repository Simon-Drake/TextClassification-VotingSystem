[Combination of real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serum galactomannan in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) assay combined with serum galactomannan (GM) detection in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) with hematological malignancies or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: Eighty patients were enrolled. PCR and GM were performed simultaneously on 205 serum samples. The agreement between these two assays and the diagnostic value of the combination were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 5 proven IA, 20 probable IA, 34 possible IA and 21 non-IA. Agreement between real-time PCR and GM was 77.5%. When both positive, the positive predictive value could reach 100%; when both negative, the negative predictive value could reach 90.9%. CONCLUSION: PCR agrees well with GM. When these two assays are combined, invasive aspergillosis can be diagnosed more accurately.
