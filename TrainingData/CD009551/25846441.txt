[Central nervous system Vasculitis due to infectious diseases].
Varicella zoster virus may cause vasculitis or vasculopathy, and positive polymerase chain reactions for varicella zoster virus deoxyribonucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid and/or the intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to the varicella zoster virus suggest these diagnoses. Meningovascular syphilis may involve the middle cerebral artery and basilar artery and may cause a stroke. Aspergillus is vasoinvasive and may cause hemorrhagic infarction by forming an intravascular thrombus.
