Cloning and characterization of a chitosanase gene from the koji mold Aspergillus oryzae strain IAM 2660.
A genomic copy of the gene coding for chitosanase (csnA) was isolated from Aspergillus oryzae IAM 2660. A. oryzae csnA contains an open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide of 245 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26,500 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of A. oryzae csnA indicates extensive similarities to those of other fungal chitosanases.
