Molecular cloning of an alpha-glucosidase-like gene from Penicillium minioluteum and structure prediction of its gene product.
The dexC cDNA, which is expressed in dextran-containing medium by the filamentous fungus Penicillium minioluteum, was cloned and sequence characterized. The cDNA sequence comprises 1859 bp plus a poly (A) tail, coding for a predicted protein of 597 amino acids. The genomic counterpart was isolated by PCR, finding three introns in its sequence. The dexC gene was located by Southern blot in the same 9-kb fragment that the previously isolated dextranase-encoding gene (dexA). Sequence analysis revealed that the deduced DexC protein belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 13, showing a high sequence identity (58%) with Aspergillus parasiticus alpha-1,6-glucosidase. In addition, the high sequence identity (51%) between DexC protein and oligo-1,6-glucosidase of Bacillus cereus, with three-dimensional (3D) structure determined, leads us to proposed a 3D model for the structural core of DexC protein.
