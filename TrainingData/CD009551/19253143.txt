Risk stratification for invasive aspergillosis: early assessment of host susceptibility.
Outcomes of invasive aspergillosis are substantially improved with early initiation of therapy. Unfortunately, the diagnosis remains difficult to establish so that early suspicion of infection is imperative. Identification of high risk patients and use of non-culture-based diagnostics and radiographic studies can facilitate earlier recognition of infection. It is important to realize that the timing and spectrum of risk for invasive aspergillosis have expanded. While patients with hematological malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplants make up the highest risk groups, patients such as those receiving steroids and other immunosuppressive therapies are also at risk. Non-culture-based methods (including galactomannan, 1,3-beta-D-glucan, and PCR-based methods) are actively being pursued to improve early diagnosis. Thus, identifying patients at high risk for infection and utilizing non-culture-based methods and radiologic studies to assist in establishing a likely diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis will further enhance the role of new agents in the early, effective treatment and prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis.
