Faster genetic identification of medically important aspergilli by using gellan gum as gelling agent in mycological media.
Using gellan gum as a substitute for agar-agar in a mycological medium and sequencing of the ITS 1 and 2 regions resulted in an accurate identification of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus ustus within 24 h of subculture.
