[Broad-range fungal PCR in diagnosis of complicated infective endocarditis].
UNLABELLED: Infective endocarditis (IE) frequently causes problems in diagnosis, especially where blood cultures are negative and when IE has fungal etiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of broad-range fungal PCR in diagnosis of fungal super-infection of bacterial IE. Twenty five blood samples were taken for analysis from patients with infective endocarditis. IE was diagnosed according to Duke criteria including positive blood cultures. Suspicion of fungal superinfection was established in 5 patients on serological investigation and confirmed by blood culture in 2 patients. Control group consisted of 15 patients without infection. DNA was isolated using the commercially available S.N.A.P. kit. Amplification products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Fungal DNA was found in 2 patients with fungal super-infection of bacterial IE confirmed by culture. In the remaining patients with IE and controls no fungal DNA was found. CONCLUSION: Broad-range fungal PCR is a fast and inexpensive tool for the detection of fungal DNA. The method may be valuable in the diagnosis of fungal super-infection of bacterial IE.
