RAPD typing of Aspergillus chevalieri, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus tetrazonus (quadrilineatus) and their teleomorphs using 5'-d[AACGCGCAAC]-3' and 5'-d[CCCGTCAGCA]-3' primers.
Sexuality in fungi has long been a matter of concerns and debates that always necessitated extensive analysis of the relationship between organisms assumed to represent different developmental forms of the same organism. Moreover, mating-virulence correlation and the growing worry of opportunistic fungal infections in immunocompromised states associated with AIDS, cancer chemotherapy and organ transplantation protocols have been critically addressed nowadays. In view of that, we genetically characterized Aspergillus chevalieri, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus tetrazonus (quadrilineatus) and their teleomorphs with RAPD analysis using 5'-d[AACGCGCAAC]-3' and 5'-d[CCCGTCAGCA]-3' primers. The reported similarities between the sexual and the asexual forms of the tested species, using Dice coefficient, ranged between 40% and 70% which holds pretty much with the current systematics of the genus. The study presents a rapid consistent method for identification of A. chevalieri, A. nidulans, A. tetrazonus (quadrilineatus) and their teleomorphs based on the banding pattern of RAPD-generated fragments that can be reliably used ahead of further applications on these species.
