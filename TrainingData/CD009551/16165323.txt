Screening and identification of the levoglucosan kinase gene (lgk) from Aspergillus niger by LC-ESI-MS/MS and RT-PCR.
A protein of 75,000 Daltons with levoglucosan kinase activity was purified from Aspergillus niger. After in-gel digestion by trypsin, a 14-mer peptide was sequenced and analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Using a primer derived from the 14-mer peptide in combination with Oligo-(dT)18, a cDNA fragment was obtained by RT-PCR. A search of the GenBank database indicated that the protein had not been identified before. A similar protein named hypothetical protein FG07802.1 (EAA77996.1) was found to exist in Gibberella zeae by Blastx search. Using a primer derived from the protein, a cDNA fragment of second RT-PCR was cloned into plasmid pAJ401, which was transformed to Saccharomyces cerevisiae H158 and expressed. Two positive levoglucosan assimilating recombinants were selected. The lgk gene was screened and identified.
