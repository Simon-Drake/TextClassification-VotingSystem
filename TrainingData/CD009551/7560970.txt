Molecular typing of Aspergillus species.
In the last four years, several molecular typing methods have been applied to various Aspergillus species, primarily A. fumigatus and A. niger. Many 'clones' or DNA types exist in the environment and in patients. The most discriminatory methods appear to be restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with or without specific probes and random amplification of polymorphic DNA analysis. Insufficient work on interlaboratory reproducibility has been done. Most patients are infected by single DNA types, although occasionally multiple isolates are detected. Little work has been done with regard to detailed hospital epidemiology using molecular typing methods.
