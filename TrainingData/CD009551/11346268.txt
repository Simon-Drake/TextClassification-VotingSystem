Afut2, a new family of degenerate gypsy-like retrotransposon from Aspergillus fumigatus.
Four recombinant lambda clones containing non-ribosomal repetitive DNA sequences useful for fingerprinting Aspergillus fumigatus strains contained a new member of the gypsy family of retrotransposons, Afut2. It is 5810 bp in length with long terminal repeats of 245 bp and is defective. All non-ribosomal repetitive DNA sequences isolated so far in A. fumigatus are defective retrotransposons of the gypsy family.
