[Identification of a bacterium with activities of inhibiting growth of fungi].
HB02 is characterized as a new microbiological agent that has the potential to decrease the toxicity of mildewed wheat containing Deoxynivalenol (DON). To explore whether HB02 could inhibit the growth of fungi, a spore suspension of Aspergillus flavus or Gibberellazeae was incubated with or without HB02 in PYG medium at 28 degrees C for 15d. The mycelium was weighed after 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 d of incubation, respectively. The result showed that the growth of these two important fungi was significantly inhibited by co-cultivation with HB02. Besides, HB02 was confirmed as Lactobacillus curvatus by its microbiological characters and the 16s-23s rRNA sequence. In conclusion, HB02, identified as Lactobacillus curvatus, prevent the effects of mycotoxins in contaminated feed by inhibiting the growth of fungi. Other detoxification ways of HB02 remain further study.
