New restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers for Aspergillus fumigatus.
In this study, we isolated and tested restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers for Aspergillus fumigatus based on PCR products amplified by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primer R108. Four DNA fragments, Afd, Af5, Af4, and Af4A, were amplified. Fragments Afd and Af5 were 85% and 88% identical at the DNA level to part of the Afut1 retrotransposon from A. fumigatus. Fragment Af4A is a duplication of fragment Af4 and both showed similarity at the amino acid level with endonucleases from other fungal retrotransposons. We used both RAPD with primer R108 and RFLP assays with Afut1, Afd, and Af4A, to determine the genetic relatedness of clinical isolates of A. fumigatus isolated sequentially from four patients colonized with A. fumigatus. The combination of these different methods suggested that the isolates infecting the four patients were not identical.
