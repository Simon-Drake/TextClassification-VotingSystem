Rapid detection and identification of pathogenic fungi by polymerase chain reaction amplification of large subunit ribosomal DNA.
We describe a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based approach to the detection and identification of pathogenic fungi which has potential for the diagnosis of systemic mycoses. Primers to sequences of the large subunit ribosomal DNA genes, which are universally conserved within the fungal kingdom, were capable of amplifying DNA from 43 strains representing 20 species (12 genera) of medically important fungi. Sequence analysis of the products obtained from Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans allowed us to design species-specific primers which only amplified homologous DNA. The use of these two PCRs in tandem allows the detection (universal PCR) and identification (species-specific PCR) of a fungal pathogen within 8 h from simulated clinical specimens.
