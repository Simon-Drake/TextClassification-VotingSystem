Nitrogen regulation in Aspergillus: are two fingers better than one?
The areA gene, mediating nitrogen metabolite repression in Aspergillus nidulans, encodes a positive-acting regulatory protein with a single putative DNA-binding 'zinc finger' which is remarkably similar to the two 'zinc fingers' of the major regulatory protein of vertebrate erythroid cells (GF-1/Eryf1/NF-E1). The areA-300 mutation alters the specificity of gene activation in that it elevates expression of certain structural genes whilst reducing expression of certain others. It is an 'in-frame' tandem duplication of 417 bp including the entire DNA-binding region. The consequences of areA didactyly are further explored by construction of a double mutant having an altered loop residue in the N-terminal 'finger'.
