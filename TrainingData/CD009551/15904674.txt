A fungal tRNA of Aspergillus niger induces IFN-beta synthesis in HEp-2 cells.
In this work, we evaluated the capacity of a fungal transfer RNA (F-tRNA) from Aspergillus niger to protect HEp-2 cells against a viral infection, and as an inducer of IFN-beta synthesis. HEp-2 cells previously incubated with F-tRNA, polyI:polyC, or IFN-alpha, at different concentrations for 24 h were infected with 200 pfu of adenovirus type 6 (AdV-6); after 5 days, we determined cellular viability, cytopathic effect of the virus, optimal concentration necessary to inhibit the cytopathic effect, and IFN-beta expression by RT-PCR. Results showed that HEp-2 cells treated with F-tRNA were less susceptible to the cytopathic effect of AdV-6 infection than those incubated with polyI:polyC (p < 0.05). On the other hand, F-tRNA- treated HEp-2 cells expressed IFN-beta mRNA, whereas monolayers incubated with polyI:polyC or IFN-alpha did not. Our results suggest that F-tRNA protected HEp-2 cells against AdV-6 infection, due to its capacity to induce IFN-beta synthesis.
