[Aspergillosis for the pulmonologist].
Aspergillus is involved in various lung illnesses related to type of exposition and immunity host response, local (tracheobronchial) and global. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is due to a hypersensitivity response, diagnosis must be considered in presence of severe asthma with radiologic opacities, blood eosinophilia and elevated total serum IgE levels. Bronchial colonization is often accidentally discovered, but needs a monitoring. Pulmonary aspergilloma, often asymptomatic, grows in a preexisting cavity. Aspergillus bronchitis is a prolonged superficious endobronchial infection. Pseudomembranous necrotizing tracheobronchitis is a microinvasive bronchial infection, which prognosis is very bad. Acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis affects quite always immunocompromised patients, but cases are not exceptional in patients with prior lung disease. Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis may be divided in chronic cavitary and chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis, and subacute invasive aspergillosis according to the course of the disease, radiological outcome first. Management of diseases caused by Aspergillus is evolving with new diagnostic tools (PCR, Aspergillus antigenemia) and with new generation antifungal drugs.
