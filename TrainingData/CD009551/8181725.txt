A pyruvate decarboxylase gene from Aspergillus parasiticus.
A gene encoding a putative pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) was isolated from a genomic library of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus parasiticus strain SU-1. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 37% homology to PDC1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although A. parasiticus has an obligate growth requirement for oxygen, it produced ethanol in shake flask cultures indicating a response to anoxic conditions mediated by pyruvate decarboxylase.
