Ketosynthase domain probes identify two subclasses of fungal polyketide synthase genes.
Analysis of fungal polyketide synthase gene sequences suggested that these might be divided into two subclasses, designated WA-type and MSAS-type. Two pairs of degenerate PCR primers (LC1 and LC2c, LC3 and LC5c) were designed for the amplification of ketosynthase domain fragments from fungal PKS genes in each of these subclasses. Both primer pairs were shown to amplify one or more PCR products from the genomes of a range of ascomycetous Deuteromycetes and Southern blot analysis confirmed that the products obtained with each pair of primers emanated from distinct genomic loci. PCR products obtained from Penicillium patulum and Aspergillus parasiticus with the LC1/2c primer pair and from Phoma sp. C2932 with both primer pairs were cloned and sequenced; the deduced protein sequences were highly homologous to the ketosynthase domains of other fungal PKS genes. Genes from which LC1/2c fragments were amplified (WA-type) were shown by a phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to fungal PKS genes involved in pigment and aflatoxin biosynthetic pathways, whereas the gene from which the LC3/5c fragment was amplified (MSAS-type) was shown to be closely related to genes encoding 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase (MSAS). The phylogenetic tree strongly supported the division of fungal PKS genes into two subclasses. The LC-series primers may be useful molecular tools to facilitate the cloning of novel fungal polyketide synthase genes.
