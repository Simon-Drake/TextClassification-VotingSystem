Comparison between plasma and whole blood specimens for detection of Aspergillus DNA by PCR.
Ninety-six plasma and whole blood specimens from nine selected patients were analyzed for the presence of Aspergillus DNA. Nineteen specimens from three patients with proven aspergillosis were PCR positive in both materials, whereas an additional 22 were PCR positive in whole blood only. All 36 samples from six patients without signs of aspergillosis were negative in both assays. We conclude that although plasma and whole blood spiked with Aspergillus conidia showed an identical lower detection limit (10 CFU), the sensitivity of plasma PCR was lower than that of PCR performed on whole blood samples.
