Cloning and expression of pkaC and pkaR, the genes encoding the cAMP-dependent protein kinase of Aspergillus fumigatus.
This report describes the cloning and expression of both subunits of PKA in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. The predicted translation product of the regulatory subunit, pkaR, is defined as a type II regulatory subunit. The gene encoding the A. fumigatus catalytic subunit, pkaC, contains the conserved kinase and activation domains that are characteristic of PkaC proteins. Both subunit mRNAs are expressed throughout the asexual life cycle of A. fumigatus. Message levels of pkaR and pkaC are higher during co-cultivation with alveolar epithelial cells than during culture alone.
