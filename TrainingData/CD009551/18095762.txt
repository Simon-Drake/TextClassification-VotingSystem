The isoepoxydon dehydrogenase gene PCR profile is useful in fungal taxonomy.
This study evaluates the specificity of PCR isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (idh) primers on fungi associated with patulin production. The DNAs of 93 strains were extracted and analysed by PCR using primers of the idh gene of patulin biosynthesis. A single band at 620 bp was obtained on 17% of the analysed strains. Different molecular weight amplicons were observed in other strains. These were employed as binary characters for numerical analysis to obtain a dendrogram. Clusters were observed, which corresponded to morphological identifications in some cases. Amplicons at 400 and/or 500 bp were related to patulin non-detection for strains, whereas a 450 bp amplicon was associated with some Aspergillus and both of the Byssochlamys nivea strains tested. Hence, the idh primers are not specific for the gene and provide other amplicon products in other species. These results were useful providing (a) profiles of DNA to identify and classify fungi and (b) insights into patulin production. The DNA profiles in this study may be useful for the potential of patulin producing fungi. Obtaining multiple bands in culture-independent PCR of environmental samples by using the primers could indicate that more than one species is present.
