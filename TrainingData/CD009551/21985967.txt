Transcription of Aspergillus nidulans pacC is modulated by alternative RNA splicing of palB.
Fungi have evolved elaborate signal transduction networks for remodeling metabolic pathways to scavenge nutrients, including the secretion of nutritional enzymes. This adaptive response involves the conserved PacC/Pal signal transduction pathway, which mediates the transcriptional response to ambient pH. In this study, we show that transcription of the gene for PacC is modulated in response to nutrient changes, phosphate and carbon sources, and pH. In addition, we show that transcription of pacC is modulated in response to alternative RNA splicing of the palB gene. These results reveal novel aspects of the complex network involved in modulation of pacC.
