Critical stages of extracting DNA from Aspergillus fumigatus in whole-blood specimens.
A standardized protocol for extracting DNA from Aspergillus fumigatus has been proposed by the European Aspergillus PCR Initiative (EAPCRI). Using meta-regression analysis, the EAPCRI showed certain stages of the process to be critical to providing a satisfactory analytical sensitivity. The study investigated each step of the EAPCRI protocol by elimination and monitored the influence on Aspergillus PCR performance.
