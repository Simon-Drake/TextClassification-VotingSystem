Cloning, expression of a feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus usamii E001 and its applicability in generating ferulic acid from wheat bran.
A cDNA gene (AufaeA), which encodes a mature polypeptide of the type-A feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus usamii E001 (abbreviated to AuFaeA), was cloned and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. One transformant, labeled as P. pastoris GSFaeA4-8, expressing the highest recombinant AuFaeA (reAuFaeA) activity of 10.76 U/ml was selected by the flask expression test. The expressed reAuFaeA was purified to homogeneity with an apparent molecular weight of 36.0 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis, and characterized using the model substrate of methyl ferulate (MFA). The purified reAuFaeA was optimally active at pH 5.0 and 45 degrees C, and highly stable at pH 4.0-6.5 and 45 degrees C or below. Its activity was not significantly affected by metal ions tested and EDTA. The K m and V max of reAuFaeA towards MFA were 4.64 mM and 115.5 U/mg, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that only 9.7 % of total alkali-extractable ferulic acid (FA) was released from destarched wheat bran by reAuFaeA alone. The released FA increased to 36.5 % when reAuFaeA was used together with a recombinant Aspergillus usamii GH family 11 xylanase A, indicating a synergistic interaction between them.
