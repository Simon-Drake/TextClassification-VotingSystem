A simple PCR/RFLP analysis can differentiate between Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus fumigatus.
The clinical management of immunocompromised patients depends on the rapid identification of infectious agents such as fungal pathogens. The procedure described here for accomplishing this uses a sensitive polymerase chain reaction method, previously reported, combined with restriction-enzyme digestion to distinguish between Candida and Aspergillus species and to classify Aspergillus strains.
