Development and evaluation of loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid and inexpensive detection of cytomegalovirus DNA in vitreous specimens from suspected cases of viral retinitis.
A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) was developed and evaluated. The LAMP assay specifically amplified only CMV DNA, and no cross-reactivity with the DNA of herpes simplex virus type 1, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, Aspergillus flavus, or Staphylococcus aureus was observed. The sequences of the LAMP assay-positive CMV products were perfectly (100%) matched with the CMV sequence deposited in the GenBank database. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was found to be 10 copies/microl of CMV DNA. Vitreous samples from 40 patients with suspected retinitis were subjected to LAMP and real-time PCR for the detection of CMV. Of 40 patients with suspected viral retinitis, 10 tested positive for CMV by the real-time PCR and LAMP assays. A 100% concordance was observed between the results of the two methods. The LAMP assay is a rapid, highly specific, and sensitive method for the diagnosis of retinitis caused by CMV.
