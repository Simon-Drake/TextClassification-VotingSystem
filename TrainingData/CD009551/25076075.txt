Molecular determination of mixed infections of dermatophytes and nondermatophyte molds in individuals with onychomycosis.
BACKGROUND: Reports of mixed infections with nondermatophyte molds (NDMs) and dermatophytes in onychomycosis are rare, possibly owing to the inhibition of NDM growth during traditional culture. We sought to determine the prevalence of mixed infections in onychomycosis using molecular identification. METHODS: Molecular analyses were used to identify infecting organisms directly from at least two serial great toenail samples from each of the 44 patients. RESULTS: Mixed infections were present in 41% of the patients (18 of 44). A single coinfecting NDM was the most common mixed infection and was detected in 34% of patients with onychomycosis (15 of 44), with Fusarium oxysporum present in 14% (6 of 44), Scopulariopsis brevicaulis in 9% (4 of 44), Acremonium spp in 2% (1 of 44), Aspergillus spp in 4.5% (2 of 44), and Scytalidium spp in 4.5% (2 of 44). Mixed infections with two NDMs were found in 7% of patients (3 of 44). CONCLUSIONS: Mixed onychomycosis infections may be more prevalent than previously reported.
