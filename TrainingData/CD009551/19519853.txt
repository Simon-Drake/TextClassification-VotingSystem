Effect of different sample volumes on the DNA extraction of Aspergillus fumigatus from whole blood.
Five methods were compared, using conventional PCR, for the isolation of DNA from Aspergillus fumigatus conidia from 1-3-mL samples of whole blood. A lower detection threshold of Aspergillus conidia was achieved using 3-mL rather than 1-mL samples with three of five methods tested.
