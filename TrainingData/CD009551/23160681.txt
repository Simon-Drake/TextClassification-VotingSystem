Detection of invasive fungal pathogens by real-time PCR and high-resolution melting analysis.
BACKGROUND/AIM: Causative agents most frequently encountered in systemic infections are bacteria, although fungi that cause invasive infections have also emerged, mostly in immune-compromised patients. The early detection and adequate treatment of bloodstream infections are critical for successful treatment. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and efficient method for the detection and differentiation of the most common fungal pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and consecutive high-resolution melting analysis was used for the detection and differentiation of fungal pathogens. RESULTS: The developed analysis procedure proved appropriate for discrimination of the ten most relevant Candida species, four Aspergillus species, and Cryptococcus neoformans. The sensitivity of the PCR reaction was 5, which is suitable for the detection of these fungi in blood. CONCLUSION: This technique is not adaptable as a general identification method, but it is highly useful when certain fungal species are to be expected in clinical samples.
