Sequencing of a gene encoding a member of the mitochondrial carrier family of transport proteins from Aspergillus nidulans.
Mitochondrial carrier proteins comprise a superfamily of evolutionarily conserved proteins that regulate the specific transport of essential metabolites across the mitochondrial membranes. In this report we describe the cloning and sequencing of a gene from Aspergillus nidulans, amc-1, that encodes the first reported example of a mitochondrial carrier protein in Aspergillus species. The amc-1 gene is located on chromosome 7, and is transcribed as a 1.6 kb unspliced polyadenylated RNA. The predicted translation product of the amc-1. cDNA displays three tandemly repeated domains which possess protein signature motifs that are characteristic of mitochondrial carrier proteins that localize to the inner mitochondrial membrane. amc-1 shares the greatest similarity with a Neurospora mitochondrial carrier protein that is implicated in basic amino acid transport, suggesting that the amc-1 protein may provide a related function.
