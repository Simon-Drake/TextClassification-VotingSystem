Vertebral osteomyelitis and epidural abscess due to Aspergillus nidulans resulting in spinal cord compression: case report and literature review.
Vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus nidulans is rare and usually affects immunocompromised patients. This report presents a case of thoracic vertebral osteomyelitis with epidural abscesses due to A. nidulans in a 40-year-old immunocompetent female who presented with back pain, numbness and weakness of both lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated osteomyelitis involving the thoracic (T)1-T3 vertebral bodies with epidural abscesses, resulting in spinal compression. The patient underwent a decompression laminectomy of T1-T3 and debridement of the thoracic epidural inflammatory granuloma. Histopathology revealed fungal granulomatous inflammation. The patient received 6 mg/kg voriconazole every 12 h (loading dose on day 1) followed by 4 mg/kg voriconazole twice daily for 1 month, administered intravenously. The patient returned with recurrent back pain 16 months after initial presentation. A. nidulans was identified by fungal culture and polymerase chain reaction. The patient showed no evidence of recurrence 1 year after a 6-month course of oral voriconazole. The key to the effective treatment of Aspergillus osteomyelitis is not to excise the abscess, but to administer systemic antifungal drug therapy.
