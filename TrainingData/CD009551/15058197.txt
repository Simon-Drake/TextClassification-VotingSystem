Detection of aflatoxigenic fungi in feeds using the PCR method.
The possibility of using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to speed up and specify the detection of aflatoxigenic fungi isolated from feed was investigated. The method, applied to 2 genes encoding the biosynthesis of aflatoxins (apa-2 and ver-1), was optimized on two collection cultures (Aspergillus flavus CCM F-108 and A. parasiticus CCM F-550). The specificity of the optimized PCR method was proved on collection cultures of different kinds of fungi. Fifty feed samples out of which 18 showed positive findings of aflatoxigenic fungi on an Aspergillus Flavus and Parasiticus Agar (AFPA) medium were tested. Isolated strains of Aspergillus strains were verified using the PCR method; its reaction products were detected in 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis. The results almost exclusively matched those gained from the AFPA medium.
