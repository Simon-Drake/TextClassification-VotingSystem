Evaluation of the role of real-time PCR in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.
Recently, two developments relating to the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) have occurred. First, the standardisation of criteria for determining the category of this disease according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis (EORTC) Study Group consensus definitions has allowed comparison of results from different studies to be undertaken. The second development is the generation of PCR assays based on real-time technologies that are able to quantify Aspergillus DNA. In this review the benefits and limitations of these new published assays are compared with nested-PCR assays and enzyme immuno assays. Results from studies where these real-time assays have been used and patient's infections were classified according the EORTC definitions are examined. The effect of anti-fungal treatment is noted. The requirement for both international standards and a consensus protocol that is sensitive enough for IA diagnosis, particularly in blood, is discussed.
