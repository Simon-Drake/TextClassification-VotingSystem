[PCR-based diagnosis of mucormycosis in tissue samples].
Mucormycosis is characterized by a rapid, often fatal progression. Early diagnosis of invasive mucormycosis is the key for timely therapeutic intervention and improved survival. Contrary to the more prevalent aspergillosis, effective antifungal therapy of mucormycosis is mainly limited to amphotericin B. Given the importance to guide the timely initiation of amphotericin B and possible surgical intervention, rapid and specific identification of fungal hyphae is essential. Conventional histopathology depends on abundance and morphology of the fungi as well as on the skills of the personnel, and usually shows an accuracy of 80 %. PCR assays targeting fungal ribosomal genes to identify Mucorales at least at genus level increase sensitivity, allow a rapid identification as well as detection of double mold infections. Thus, PCR assays are beneficial to complement existing approaches. They are recommended to rapidly specify tissue diagnosis and accurate identification of fungi. This will help to guide effective therapy and thereby, survival will increase. Retrospective analyses of mucormycosis by PCR help to evaluate therapeutic interventions and will optimize treatment options.
