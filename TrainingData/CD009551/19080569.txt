[The value of real-time PCR analysis of serum samples for early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in organ transplant recipients].
OBJECTIVE: To study the value of Aspergillus real-time PCR as a tool for diagnosing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis(IPA) from serum samples in organ transplant recipients. METHODS: From Jan.2004 to Mar.2006, 59 organ transplant recipients from Shanghai First People's Hospital with high possibility of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were evaluated. Of the 59 patients, 5 had proven, 6 had probable, and 18 had possible invasive Aspergillus infection according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group definitions. A total of 274 serum samples were analyzed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: Seven of these immunocompromised patients were PCR positive, correlating with positive sputum cultures, positive histology, and positive signs of CT scans. False negative results were found in 2 patients. They had positive PCR results without any correlation to clinical or other diagnostic criteria. Twenty-eight immunocompromised patients with a negative PCR result showed no evidence of invasive fungal disease. Compared with sputum culture, CT scan and galactomannan test, PCR positivity preceded diagnosis by a mean of 7.9 d, 6.0 d, 1.5 d, respectively. CONCLUSION: Aspergillus real-time PCR is a helpful test for the early diagnosis of IPA in high-risk organ transplant recipients.
