Molecular and serological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis: new answers to old questions?
Over the recent years, novel molecular and serological methods have been developed to improve diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients at high risk for fungal infections, especially patients with malignant haematological diseases undergoing intensive chemotherapy. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in the management of fungal infections. However, diagnosis often remains difficult as most of the diagnostic tools in clinical use at present either lack specificity or acceptable sensitivity in the early phase of the infection. The clinical value, advantages and problems of current molecular and serological approaches to diagnose IA are reviewed.
