[Laboratory diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis].
Invasive aspergillosis is major cause of morbility and mortality in immunosuppressed patients, in part due to the inability to identify infected patients at an early stage of the disease. Diagnosis is based on a combination of imaging (high-resolution computed tomography) and a number of laboratory techniques including direct examination, culture and circulating markers (galactomannan and Aspergillus DNA) which can be detected at early stages of the infection.
