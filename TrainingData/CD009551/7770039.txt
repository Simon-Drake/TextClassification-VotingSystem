Polarity of meiotic gene conversion is 5' to 3' within the niaD gene of Aspergillus nidulans.
We have examined polarity of meiotic gene conversion in the niiA-niaD gene cluster of Aspergillus nidulans in two-point crosses. The type and position of the mutations represented by the niaD alleles and the correlation between the relative frequency of gene conversion and the physical position of these mutations were determined. We show that polarity of meiotic gene conversion is 5' to 3' (transcribed strand) within the niaD gene. Additional crosses involving a niiA allele and a niaD allele show little polarity of gene conversion, which suggests that the recombination events leading to restoration of the niaD gene are initiated upstream of the coding region of the niaD gene but within the niiA-niaD gene cluster, possibly within the intergenic promoter region.
