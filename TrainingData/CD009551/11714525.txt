Analysis of fungal communities on historical church window glass by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and phylogenetic 18S rDNA sequence analysis.
Besides lichens and bacteria, fungi play a crucial role in the biodeterioration of historical glass. In the present paper, the fungal diversity on the surface of two historical church window glasses was investigated by 18S rDNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. 566-bp 18S rDNA-specific clone libraries were constructed with primer set NS1/NS2+10. Positive clones were reamplified with primer sets EF4/518rGC (426-bp fragments) and NS26/518rGC (316-bp fragments), amplicons were screened by DGGE and clustered according to their position in DGGE. Results indicated that fungal 18S rDNA clone libraries should be screened with at least two different primer sets to obtain the maximum number of different clones. For phylogenetic sequence analyses, clone inserts were sequenced and compared with 18S rDNA sequences listed in the EMBL database. Similarity values ranged from 93.7% to 99.81% to known fungi. Analyses revealed complex fungal communities consisting of members and relatives of the genera Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Coniosporum, Capnobotryella, Engyodontium, Geomyces, Kirschsteiniothelia, Leptosphaeria, Rhodotorula, Stanjemonium, Ustilago, and Verticillium. The genera Geomyces and Aureobasidium were present on both glass surfaces. Some genera had not been detected on historical glass so far.
