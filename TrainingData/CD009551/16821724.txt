Primer R108 performs best in the RAPD strain typing of three Aspergillus species frequently isolated from patients.
We evaluated the suitability of various primers for the RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) accurate species identification and strain typing of Aspergillus clinical isolates. Five primers described previously were tested for their discriminatory power in three Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus, A. niger agg. and A. flavus - 23 clinical isolates and 2 reference strains). Clustering of RAPD fingerprints corresponded well with the identification based on morphological features. All isolates were resolved as different strains using the primer R108 and the RAPD protocol optimized for a Robocycler thermal cycler. RAPD with the primer R108 thus can be considered to be a valuable, simple and powerful tool for identification and strain delineation of Aspergillus spp.
