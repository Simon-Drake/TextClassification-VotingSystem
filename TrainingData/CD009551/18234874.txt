Rapid detection of triazole antifungal resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus.
Triazole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus is an uncommon but rising phenomenon. Susceptibility testing is rarely performed and can take 48 h or longer, which is an impediment to effective therapy. Molecular diagnostic probing of well-defined resistance mechanisms, which serve as surrogate markers, provides an alternative approach to rapidly (within hours) and efficiently identify resistant strains. The mechanisms of triazole resistance in A. fumigatus are limited to amino acid substitutions in the drug target Cyp51A and include amino acid substitutions at the positions Gly 54, Gly 138, Met 220, and Leu 98, coupled with a tandem repetition in the gene promoter. We report the development of a real-time PCR assay utilizing molecular beacons to assess triazole resistance markers in A. fumigatus. When combined in a multiplex platform, the assay provides a comprehensive evaluation of drug resistance in A. fumigatus.
