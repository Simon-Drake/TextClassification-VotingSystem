Cloning and functional expression of the mitochondrial alternative oxidase of Aspergillus fumigatus and its induction by oxidative stress.
Aspergillus fumigatus possesses a branched mitochondrial electron transport chain, with both cyanide-sensitive and -insensitive oxygen-consumption activities. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species mediate signaling for alternative oxidase (AOX) expression. A 1173 bp-long Afaox gene encoding a 40 kDa protein has been cloned and identified. Recombinant constructs containing the Afaox ORF were transformed into Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for heterologous expression. In A. fumigatus, AOX activity and mRNA expression were both induced with menadione or paraquat, suggesting an important role of AOX under oxidative stress. Therefore, positive transformants showed a cyanide-resistant and salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive respiration, whereas in control cells the oxygen uptake was completely inhibited after KCN addition.
