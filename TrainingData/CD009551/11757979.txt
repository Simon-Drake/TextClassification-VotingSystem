Diagnosis of disseminated zygomycosis using a polymerase chain reaction assay.
Invasive pulmonary zygomycosis is an uncommon opportunistic infection in patients with haematological malignancies. Clinical manifestations are in distinguishable from the more frequent invasive aspergillosis. Standard diagnostic methods like culture and microscopy from respiratory secretions have a low diagnostic sensitivity. A case in which proven invasive pulmonary zygomycosis was confirmed using a panfungal polymerase chain reaction assay in blood is presented. Since zygomycosis requires more aggressive treatment than aspergillosis (high-dose amphotericin B and surgical intervention), the polymerase chain reaction assay may improve the outcome of these often fatal infections by guiding the therapeutic approach through an early, non-invasive diagnosis.
