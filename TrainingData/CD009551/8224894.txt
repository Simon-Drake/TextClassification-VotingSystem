The cloning and sequencing of the genes encoding phytase (phy) and pH 2.5-optimum acid phosphatase (aph) from Aspergillus niger var. awamori.
The genes encoding phytase (EC 3.1.3.8) and pH 2.5-optimum acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) have been cloned and sequenced from Aspergillus niger var. awamori. The translated nucleotide sequences yielded polypeptides of 467 and 479 amino acids (aa) for phytase and acid phosphatase, respectively. The genes were isolated using oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes based on the aa sequences of the purified proteins. Recombinant A. niger var. awamori strains carrying additional copies of the gene sequences demonstrated elevated enzyme activities.
