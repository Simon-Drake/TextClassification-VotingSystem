Identification of species in Aspergillus section Flavi based on sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene.
The partial sequences of the mitochondrial (mt) cytochrome b gene (402 bp) were determined for species of Aspergillus section Flavi. On the basis of identities of DNA sequences, 77 strains were divided into seven DNA types, from D-1 to D-7. The type strains of A. sojae, A. parasiticus, A. flavus and A. oryzae together, A. tamarii, and A. nomius were placed in DNA types D-1. D-2, D-4, D-5 and D-7, respectively. These species could be differentiated from each other. Furthermore, two other DNA types, D-3 and D-6 were found. DNA type D-3 was closely related to A. parasiticus (D-2) and included one strain that deposited as A. flatus var. flavus and produced aflatoxins B and G. DNA types D-6 included one strain named A. flavus and closely related to A. tamarii. The observations of conidial wall texture by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) supported the relationships derived from the cytochrome b gene. The production of aflatoxins was also examined. Using the DNA sequence of cytochrome b gene, several strains were reidentified. The derived amino acids sequences were all the same in the studied strains. The mt cytochrome b gene is useful and reliable in distinguishing and identifying the species in Aspergillus section Flavi.
