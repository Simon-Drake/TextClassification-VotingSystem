Fungal endocarditis in neonates and children.
Fungal endocarditis in the neonate and pediatric population is associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality, with diagnosis in the majority of cases made postmortem. The aim of this article is to review published literature on fungal endocarditis in children and to discuss the incidence due to a wide range of fungi, primarily Aspergillus and Candida species, as well as its diagnosis, including the importance of molecular-based approaches and various treatment regimes.
