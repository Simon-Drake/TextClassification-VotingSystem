Quantification of the copy number of nor-1, a gene of the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway by real-time PCR, and its correlation to the cfu of Aspergillus flavus in foods.
A real-time PCR system directed against the nor-1 gene of the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway as a target sequence has been applied to detect an aflatoxinogenic A. flavus strain in plant-type foods like maize, pepper and paprika. The system is based on the TaqMan fluorescent probe technology. The copy numbers of the nor-1 gene were compared to conventional cfu data obtained from the same set of samples. In general, a good correlation between nor-1 gene copy number and the cfu data was observed; however, the nor-1 copy numbers were always higher. It was shown that the system is specific for nor-1 containing species.
