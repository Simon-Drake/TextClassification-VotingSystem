Potential of polymerase chain reaction and galactomannan for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with febrile neutropenia.
The incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) has increased over the last years, especially in immuncompromised patients with high mortality rates. Because of difficulties about the diagnosis; serological methods [galactomannan (GM) antigen test] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) developed in recent years. MycAssay Aspergillus PCR performance in the diagnosis of IA was evaluated and compared with the GM and in-house PCR. This study was conducted with 358 serum samples obtained from 99 patient with febrile neutropenic episodes who were followed in haematology and bone marrow transplantation units. Patients were classified by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria, 18 of them is proven and probable IA. GM antigen test and two different real-time PCR; one of them is fist commercial PCR for IA; Mycassay Aspergillus and the other one is in-house real-time PCR performed. Sensitivity values were Mycassay Aspergillus PCR, in-house PCR, and GM 65.38%, 11.53% and 23.07%, respectively. The high sensitivity obtained from Mycassay Aspergillus PCR and sensitivity is increased by using a combination of diagnostic methods. GM antigen test and real-time PCR could be beneficial for early diagnosis and treatment of IA. For routine usage of PCR as diagnostic assay more studies needed in future.
