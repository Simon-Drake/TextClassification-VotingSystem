Rapid identification of Aspergillus terreus from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by PCR and electrospray ionization with mass spectrometry.
We describe the application of PCR and electrospray-ionization with mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) to culture-negative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in order to identify septate hyphae noted by Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) staining of the fluid that was obtained from an immunocompromised woman with neutropenia following induction chemotherapy for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The patient was treated with empirical antifungal therapy, including intrathecal amphotericin B, while results of fungal cultures were pending. Ultimately, Aspergillus terreus, an amphotericin-resistant mold, was cultured from bilateral brain abscesses. PCR/ESI-MS correctly identified the mold.
