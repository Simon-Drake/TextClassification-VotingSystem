Identification of medically important Aspergillus species by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) of the PCR-amplified intergenic spacer region.
The amplified 5.8S RNA coding DNA with the neighbouring internal transcribed spacers ITS I and ITS II (ITS I--5.8S rDNA--ITS II) of 27 culture collection strains of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus were investigated by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. All strains showed a polymerase gel electrophoresis (PCR) product of 0.6 kb. Separation of DNA single strands of the PCR product in an acrylamide-bisacrylamide gel containing formamide SSCP resulted in individual patterns for each of the species. A minor variability within the species A. fumigatus and A. flavus did not affect the correct species identification. The results were confirmed when investigating 55 wild strains from patients and the environment. It is concluded that the analysis of the amplified ITS I--5.8S rDNA--ITS II region by SSCP allows the differentiation of the medically most relevant aspergilli. As the method does not require morphologically fully developed fungal colonies, it yields species diagnosis faster than the conventional macroscopic and microscopic identification.
