The value of computed tomography-guided percutaneous lung biopsy for diagnosis of invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised patients.
We assessed Calcofluor white staining, Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction, and a galactomannan enzyme immunoassay for diagnosis of fungal infection with use of computed tomography-guided percutaneous lung biopsy specimens obtained from 61 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of computerized tomography, Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction, and galactomannan enzyme immunoassay were 100% and 50%, 100% and 86%, and 88% and 94%, respectively.
