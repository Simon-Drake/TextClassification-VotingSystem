In situ detection of protein-DNA interactions in filamentous fungi by in vivo footprinting.
The method described here allows the detection of protein-DNA interactions in vivo in filamentous fungi. We outline culture conditions and conditions of in vivo methylation that permit uniform modification of all cells in an apically growing, non-uniform organism, and subsequent visualization of protected areas by ligation-mediated PCR.
