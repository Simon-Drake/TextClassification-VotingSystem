Diagnosis and prevention of fungal infection in the immunocompromized patient.
Profound and prolonged neutropenia following chemotherapy is a major risk factor for systemic fungal infections. Mortality associated with disseminated fungal infection is high and treatment with conventional amphotericin B is complicated by renal toxicity. Candida and Aspergillus are among the major pathogens in this patient population. Many patients remaining neutropenic over a prolonged period of time will receive empirical antifungal therapy. The clinical and laboratory diagnosis of these infections are neither sensitive nor specific and are generally limited in the early detection of invasive fungal infection. However, several new approaches to diagnosis are being developed which should be translated into routine practice. These include antigen detection and PCR. It is still unclear how effective the various measures that are currently being used are in preventing serious fungal infection. Refinements in the prophylactic use of fluconazole, itraconazole and aerosolized amphoteric in B, and the introduction of new formulations of existing antifungals may reduce the incidence of systemic fungal infections in some patient groups. Patients with presumed fungal infection require more intense and accurate monitoring for signs of disseminated infection. Early diagnosis may guide appropriate treatment and prevent mortality.
