Use of mycological, nested PCR, and real-time PCR methods on BAL fluids for detection of Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus in solid organ transplant recipients.
Invasive aspergillosis continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. A reliable and early diagnostic method is needed to improve survival. In this study, four methods direct microscopy, culture, nested PCR on internal transcribed spacer region, and TaqMan real-time PCR targeted beta-tubulin gene were examined for the detection of Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus in sixty-four bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids that were obtained from SOT recipients. Direct examination with 20 % KOH (potassium hydroxide) and culture on mycological media were also performed. Of the 64 samples, seven (10.9 %) were positive in direct examination (five with septate hyphae and two with aseptate hyphae), and 15 (23 %) had positive culture including five A. flavus, four A. niger, two Penicillium spp., two Rhizopus spp., one Fusarium spp. and one mixed A. flavus/A. niger. Twenty five (39 %) samples had positive nested PCR with A. flavus and 6 (9.4 %) with A. fumigatus-specific primers. Only eight (12.5 %) had positive real-time PCR for A. flavus and nine (14 %) for A. fumigatus. The incidence of aspergillosis in these patients included proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in two (3 %), probable IPA in 14 (22 %), possible IPA in 38 (59 %), and not IPA in 10 (16 %). A. flavus was the most common cause of pulmonary aspergillosis (PA) in the study. The results suggest that because nested PCR is too sensitive it may increase the number of false-positive results and is not recommended for BAL samples for diagnosis of PA. Although further studies with significant number of proved positive/negative standard BAL samples are necessary for better evaluation, the novel multiplex real-time PCR developed in the study could be promising as a valid diagnostic method for IPA.
