[Molecular and immunological methods applied in diagnosis of mycoses].
The diagnosis of fungal infections remains a problem for the management of fungal diseases, particularly in the immunocompromised patients. Systemic Candida infections and invasive aspergillosis can be a serious problem for individuals who need intensive care. Traditional methods used for the identification and typing of medically important fungi, such as morphological and biochemical analysis, are time-consuming. For the diagnosis of mycoses caused by pathogenic fungi faster and more specific methods, especially after the dramatic increase in nosocomial invasive mycoses are needed. New diagnostic tools to detect circulating fungal antigens in biological fluids and PCR-based methods to detect species or genus-specific DNA or RNA have been developed. Antigen detection is limited to searching only one genus. Molecular genetic methods, especially PCR analysis, are becoming increasingly important as a part of diagnostics in the clinical mycology laboratory. Various modifications of the PCR method are used to detect DNA in clinical material, particularly multiple, nested and real-time PCR. Molecular methods may be used to detection of nucleic acids of fungi in clinical samples, to identify fungal cultures at the species level or to evaluate strain heterogeneity differences within the species. This article reviews some of the recent advances in the possibility of molecular diagnosis of fungal infections.
