Dynamics of extracellular release of Aspergillus fumigatus DNA and galactomannan during growth in blood and serum.
Aspergillus fumigatus is the major cause of invasive aspergillosis (IA), a disease associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing treatment for haematological malignancies. This study investigated A. fumigatus growth in vitro and in a murine model of IA in order to provide insights into the dynamics of extracellular DNA and galactomannan (GM) release and their relevance to early diagnosis of IA. Following inoculation of whole blood with 20 A. fumigatus conidia ml(-1), DNA that corresponded to the inoculum could be detected by PCR but GM was not detected in plasma separated from the blood sample, indicating that the fungus did not grow in whole blood. The quantities of DNA detected by PCR, and GM, were proportional to the amount of fungal biomass present in vitro. Fungal DNA could be detected in the sera of mice experimentally infected with A. fumigatus with maximum detection in cyclophosphamide-treated mice.
