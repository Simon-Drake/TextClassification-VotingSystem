Comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism, microsatellite length polymorphism, and random amplification of polymorphic DNA analyses for fingerprinting Aspergillus fumigatus isolates.
Aspergillus fumigatus fingerprints generated by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) upon hybridization with repeated DNA sequences, and PCR detection of microsatellite length polymorphism (MLP) were compared among 67 isolates. In contrast to RAPD, RFLP and MLP gave discriminating and significantly concordant genotyping results.
