Cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) III of the uterine cervix in a young female associated with AIDS.
A case of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III implying severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix in a 24 year old Japanese female patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is reported. Autopsy revealed marked systemic atrophy of lymph nodes, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, pulmonary aspergillosis, acute pancreatitis and CIN III of the portio vaginalis uteri. The human papillomavirus (HPV) genome was detected in sections of the CIN III by polymerase chain reaction. This is the first autopsy report of cervical neoplasia in a patient with AIDS in Japan, and the pathogenesis of CIN III in this case was associated with HPV infection. Gynecological examination should be mandatory for female patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
