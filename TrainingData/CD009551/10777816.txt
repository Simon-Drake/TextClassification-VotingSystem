[Fungal infections in immunocompromised patients].
The number of immunocompromised patients is increasing due to the intensive therapy being administered those with cancer, organ transplant, and HIV infection. Fungal infections are one of the important opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis is difficult, and the prognosis of these patinas is usually poor. Several methods of diagnosis for fungal infections have been developed: detection of antigens of the infected fungi from the sera is useful for early diagnosis; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology may be the most valuable method for the diagnosis of fungal infection in immunocompromised patients, and antifungal agents are the drugs used to the fungal infections in those patients. However, there are only five drugs available to fungal infections in Japan. Although amphotericin B is the recommended first choice for treatment of invasive aspergillosis, its use for immunocompromised patients is limited because of its adverse effects. Novel antifungal agents (azoles, amphotericin B drug deliver system, and 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthetase inhibitors) have been developed and some of these compounds undergoing clinical trials.
