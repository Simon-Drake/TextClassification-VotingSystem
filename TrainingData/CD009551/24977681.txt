Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in immunocompromised patients.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the evaluation of pulmonary disease in immunocompromised patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent discoveries in this field are largely in two areas: the array of diagnostic testing performed on BAL fluid and technical details that can enhance the yield from this procedure. Regarding diagnostic testing, the addition of new assays, including Aspergillus galactomannan antigen assay, respiratory viral panels, and Pneumocystis jirovecii PCR, has improved the diagnostic yield of BAL over conventional cultures and stains. To improve the diagnostic yield of the procedure itself, it should be done early in the clinical course, with the BAL in the anatomic area most affected, and with a preprocedural computed tomography of the chest to properly plan the procedure. SUMMARY: Bronchoscopic evaluation with BAL can provide important diagnostic information in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary diseases and should be routinely performed when clinically indicated and able to be completed safely.
