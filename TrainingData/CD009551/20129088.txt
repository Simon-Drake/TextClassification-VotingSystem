Optimization of a real-time PCR assay to quantitate airborne fungi collected on a gelatin filter.
The present study aimed to optimize a real-time PCR assay to quantitate airborne fungi collected on a gelatin filter. In particular, the study optimized conditions for the DNA extraction and real-time PCR amplification to accurately measure airborne fungal concentrations. First, time of fine bead homogenization to extract the DNA from fungal cells was optimized to maximize the DNA yield and prepare the DNA suitable for sensitive and precise quantification by a subsequent real-time PCR analysis. Second, a condition for the real-time PCR amplification was optimized to successfully amplify and quantitate the extracted fungal DNA. In particular, a dilution ratio of the DNA extracts to be introduced to PCR was optimized to achieve an appropriate balance between mitigating PCR inhibition and securing detection sensitivity. Since concentrations of airborne fungi generally observed in indoor and outdoor environments (i.e., 10(1)-10(4) CFU m(-3)) were found to be near the limit of quantification by the generally-used molecular-based detection technique in conjunction with use of gelatin filters, optimizations of these conditions were found to be crucial. Our preliminary result showed that a culture-based method underestimated concentrations of airborne environmental fungi by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to those characterized by the real-time PCR assay.
