Performance of enhanced biological SBR process for aniline treatment by mycelial pellet as biomass carrier.
Mycelial pellet of Aspergillus niger Y3 was used as a biomass carrier to immobilize the aniline-degrading bacterium, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus JH-9 and the mix culture of the COD rapid degradation bacteria. In order to investigate its removal effect on aniline and COD, the combined mycelial pellets were applied in the SBR. Comparison of the performances was conducted between another SBR inoculated with sole strain JH-9 and the above SBR. The results showed that the stable degradations of aniline and COD were observed in both reactors. In the SBR with combined mycelial pellet, the biological removal efficiency was about 0.9 mg aniline/(L.d). It was much higher than that in the activated sludge reactor. Meanwhile, the performances of the sedimentation velocity, liquid-solid phase separation and the effluent quality were better in the SBR. According to SEM images and PCR-DGGE analysis, the species immobilized on the biomass carrier were more predominant in this system.
