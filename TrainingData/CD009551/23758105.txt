Rep-PCR and RAPD-PCR fingerprinting of Aspergillus terreus.
We compared two PCR methods for molecular typing the medically important filamentous fungus Aspergillus terreus. In a set of 46 strains investigated we found 19 and 12 different fingerprinting types obtained by random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD) and semi-automated repetitive element PCR (rep-PCR), respectively.
