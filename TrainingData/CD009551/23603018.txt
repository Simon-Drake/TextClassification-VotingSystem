A rapid DNA assembling strategy mediated by direct full-length polymerase chain reaction.
An efficient DNA assembling strategy was developed here modified from Class-IIS endonuclease mediated DNA splicing by directed ligation (SDL). Benefited from the full-length PCR directly using ligation products as template, this strategy required less effort and less time to obtain the assembled full-length DNA. The advantages of this strategy made it a rapid and easy-to-perform gene splicing and multiple site-directed mutagenesis approach especially practicable when more fragments need to be assembled at the same time.
