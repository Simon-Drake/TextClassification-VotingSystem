[Detection of Aspergillus species DNA in serum samples of the patients with non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis].
We investigated the possible presence of Aspergillus species DNA in serum samples of two patients diagnosed as having non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The nested PCR results were negative in serum samples of the patients with chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis and pulmonary aspergilloma. When left pneumothorax happened to the patient with chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis and bronchial washing was performed to the patient with pulmonary aspergilloma, the nested PCR results turned positive. We consider this method useful for the diagnosis of semi-invasive stage of pulmonary aspergillosis. However, further prospective evaluation with a large clinical sample is required.
