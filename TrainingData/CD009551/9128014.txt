Aspergillus endocarditis in a leukemia patient diagnosed by a PCR assay.
A patient in a blastic phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia developed multiple arterial emboli that originated from mitral valve vegetation. The diagnosis of infective endocarditis was not confirmed because blood cultures, serological assays and other examinations detected no pathogens. He died of intracranial hemorrhage after thrombolytic manipulation for embolization of the abdominal aorta and an autopsy was performed. Polymerase chain reaction analysis and Southern blot analysis of tissues from the mitral valve revealed Aspergillus species as the cause of the endocarditis, although none of the tissue specimens were culture-positive. These molecular analyses will be useful in the diagnosis of various types of Aspergillus infections.
