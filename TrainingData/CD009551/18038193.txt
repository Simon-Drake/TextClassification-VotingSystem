A quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for detecting and identifying fungal contamination in human allograft tissue.
To complement donor selection and tissue processing, rapid and reliable detection, discrimination, and quantification of fungal pathogens are extremely important for tissues destined to be implanted into humans. The current detection method for fungal pathogens, in particular, is difficult and time-consuming. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology is considered one of the most sensitive methods to detect low levels of DNA. Here a qPCR method is described that can detect clinically relevant, pathogenic fungal organisms. The assay allowed the quantification of fungal organisms within a tissue implant and provides a means to identify the contaminating species. The primers for the qPCR assay were designed to amplify a conserved region of the L2 region of the large ribosomal subunit (LSU) gene. This set of primers was able to detect fewer than 10 colony forming units from Aspergillus and Candida species in spiked samples. Clinical samples were also evaluated using this method and the data compared positively to the existing accepted 28-day fungal culture method for fungal detection. The qPCR method described herein significantly reduced the time required to identify fungal contamination in tissue implants.
