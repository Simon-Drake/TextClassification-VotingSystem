Endogenous Aspergillus endophthalmitis occurring after liver transplantation: a case report.
Endogenous Aspergillus endophthalmitis (AE) is a rare complication of invasive aspergillosis in transplant patients. In this report, we have described a patient who underwent liver transplantation because of drug-induced cholestatic cirrhosis and developed AE at 2 weeks after the surgery. The patient was a 22-year-old man who received a right liver lobe from his father. The operation was uneventful but the patient developed signs and symptoms of small-for-size syndrome after the second day of surgery. The patient received intense immunosuppression with methylprednisolone for 3 days, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil from the first day after the operation, with ceftriaxone and metronidazole as prophylactic antibiotics. Because of signs of respiratory distress with pneumonia, vancomycin and amphotericin B were added empirically to his regimen. Polymerase chain reaction for aspergillus DNA in the blood was positive. The patient received one course of methylprednisolone pulse therapy for signs of acute rejection at day 10, and tacrolimus was changed to sirolimus because of a rising serum creatinine and convulsions. After 2 weeks, the patient's symptoms improved and liver function tests were normal, but the complained of sudden intense pain in the left eye with unilateral blurred vision, redness, and other signs of endophthalmitis upon examination by an ophthalmologists. After 24 hours, visual acuity decreased to light perception. AE was confirmed by microscopy and culture of the vitreous fluid and retinal biopsy. Despite changing amphotericin to intravitreal injection of voriconazole followed by intravenous voriconazole and transient resolution of the symptoms, no improvement was seen in visual acuity. Pain and signs of inflammation in the eye recurred after 2 weeks. At last the patient underwent enucleation for resistant infection and fear of involvement of the other eye by aspergillosis or sympathetic ophthalmia.
