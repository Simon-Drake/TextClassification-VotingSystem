Evaluation of mold exposure in cystic fibrosis patients' dwellings and allergic bronchopulmonary risk.
Very few studies have been conducted on cystic fibrosis (CF) patients' exposure to the indoor environment and, to our knowledge, there are no studies dealing with the link between specific fungal environmental exposure at home and fungal colonization resulting in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Fungal exposure of CF adult patients with ABPA (n=4) with fungal sensitization (n=7) and with no ABPA (n=5) was assessed in 16 homes by dust sampling with electrostatic dust fall collectors (EDCs). Aspergillus fumigatus was specifically quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs), and A. fumigatus DNA concentrations were significantly higher in homes of ABPA patients (p<0.001). Results indicate that indoor fungal contamination could be a factor favoring ABPA and suggest that environmental surveys could help in preventing fungal risk in CF patients.
