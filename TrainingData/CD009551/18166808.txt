Human herpesvirus-6 DNAemia in immunosuppressed adult patients with leukemia at risk for mold infection.
Little is known about human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) in leukemia patients. We prospectively followed 37 leukemia patients at risk for mold infection. HHV-6 DNA was detected from whole blood specimens in 11 patients (30%). History of granulocyte transfusions (p=0.05) and prior relapse of leukemia (p=0.07) were the only independent predictors of HHV-6 DNAemia.
