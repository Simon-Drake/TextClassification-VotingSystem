The first documented case of Aspergillus cardiac surgical site infection in Sweden: an epidemiology study using arbitrarily primed PCR.
Here we report two rare cases of severe thoracic Aspergillus fumigatus infections after lung and heart surgery at the same thoracic intensive care unit at the same time. The main objective was to identify a possible source of transmission. With arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction a patient-to-patient transmission could rapidly be ruled out as the cause of the first documented case of aspergillosis after open-heart surgery in Sweden. Although no definitive source was identified, a genetically similar strain was found in a contaminated supply room.
