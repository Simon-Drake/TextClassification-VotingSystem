Development of a quantitative real-time PCR assay for the detection of Aspergillus carbonarius in grapes.
Aspergillus carbonarius is the main species responsible for the production of ochratoxin A (OTA) in wine grapes. To monitor and quantify A. carbonarious in grapes, a quantitative real-time PCR assay was developed as a possible tool for predicting the potential ochratoxigenic risk. DNA extraction from grape berries was performed by using conventional extraction and clean up through EZNA Hi-bond spin columns. A TaqMan probe was used to quantify A. carbonarius genomic DNA in grape berries samples. An exogenous internal positive control was used to overcome DNA recovery losses due to matrix inhibition. The quantification of fungal genomic DNA in naturally contaminated grape was performed using the TaqMan signal versus spectrophotometrically measured DNA quantities (Log10) calibration curve with a linearity range from 50 to 5 x 10(-4) ng of DNA. A positive correlation (R2=0.92) was found between A. carbonarious DNA content and OTA concentration in naturally contaminated grape samples. This is the first application of TaqMan real-time PCR for identifying and quantifying A. carbonarius genomic DNA occurring in grapes. The rapid DNA extraction method for grapes, together with the commercial availability of reagents and instrumentation, allows to perform a remarkable number of reproducible assays (96-well format) in less than 4 h.
