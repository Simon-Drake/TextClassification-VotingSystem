Retrotransposon insertion-site context (RISC) typing: a novel typing method for Aspergillus fumigatus and a convenient PCR alternative to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
Retrotransposon(-like) sequences in Aspergillus fumigatus have been used as typing targets through restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)/Southern blotting approaches. Differences in fingerprints between unrelated isolates are the result of variations in copy-number and differences in the regions flanking the retrotransposon elements. Here, we present retrotransposon insertion-site context (RISC) typing as a novel and convenient PCR-based typing alternative to the RFLP approach. RISC typing aims at amplifying the sequences flanking the retrotransposon-like sequences in A. fumigatus and allows large numbers of isolates to be analyzed in a timely fashion with excellent discriminatory power.
