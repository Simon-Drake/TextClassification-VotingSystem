Resistant invasive aspergillosis in an autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease.
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited immunodeficiency characterized by severe bacterial and fungal infections. Invasive aspergillosis and other rare mold diseases are the leading causes of mortality. We report one case of CGD revealed by retropharyngeal abscess. On evolution, the patient developed an invasive aspergillosis resistant to treatment.
