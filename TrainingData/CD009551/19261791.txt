Interlaboratory reproducibility of a single-locus sequence-based method for strain typing of Aspergillus fumigatus.
Seven international laboratories tested the recently proposed single-locus typing strategy for Aspergillus fumigatus subtyping for interlaboratory reproducibility. Comparative sequence analyses of portions of the locus AFUA_3G08990, encoding a putative cell surface protein (denoted CSP), was performed with a panel of Aspergillus isolates. Each laboratory followed very different protocols for extraction of DNA, PCR, and sequencing. Results revealed that the CSP typing method was a reproducible and portable strain typing method.
