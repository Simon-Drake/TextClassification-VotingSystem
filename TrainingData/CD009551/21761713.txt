[Experimental and clinical study on the diagnosis for pathogenic fungi of fungal rhinosinusitis by multiplex PCR].
OBJECTIVE: To develop a multiplex PCR method used to fast diagnose pathogenic fungi of fungal rhinosinusitis. METHOD: Three pairs of primers (universal fungus-specific primers, aspergillus specific primers, mucor specific primers)were used to establish multiplex PCR system. Detected six important medical fungi species strains to examine the applicability of the system and explore the optimum conditions. Multiplex PCR system was also used to identify pathogenic fungi of fungal rhinosinusitis, and used to compare the sensitivity with fungal culture. RESULT: Three pairs of primers of the multiplex PCR system had high versatility and specificity, and could amplify the corresponding DNA fragments in the appropriate conditions. Sensitivity of the reaction system was 10 microg/L. Twenty clinical specimens of fungal sinusitis were tested by fungal culture and the multiplex PCR system, 7 (35%) cases were culture positive whereas 15 (75%) cases were positive by the multiplex PCR system, the difference was statistically significant between the two methods (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The multiplex PCR system was proved to be a rapid, sensitive and specific technology, it could be used to detect and identify clinical pathogenic fungi of fungal rhinosinusitis.
