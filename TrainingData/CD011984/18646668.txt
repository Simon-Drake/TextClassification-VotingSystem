[Down's syndrome screening in the Czech Republic].
We have better options how to screen for genetic defects during the last decade, but unfortunately in some areas of the country are not all types of the screening available. Strangely, this effect is caused by our demand for higher quality of our services, especially in ultrasound measurment. Gynaecologists should have good knowledge of all possibilities how to screen, should know the advantages, the disadvantages and the limitations of all screening tests. The article gives an overview of screening tests and it should be a guide for physicians and pregnant women what kind of screening is possible to do and what to expect from it.
