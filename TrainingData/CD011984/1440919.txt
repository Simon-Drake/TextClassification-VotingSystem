[Value of molecular-genetic examination of patients with the Shereshevsky-Terner syndrome and married couples with disorders of reproductive function].
The molecular-cytogenetic investigation gives a significant opportunity for diagnosis of gonosome mosaics. Due to the molecular-cytogenetic method additional chromosomes in karyotypes in 4 of 13 patients are determined. A significant spreading of mosaicism type 45, XO/46, X among women with early spontaneous abortions is revealed.
