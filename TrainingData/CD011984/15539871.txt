Elevated second-trimester free beta-hCG as an isolated finding and pregnancy outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between unexplained elevated second-trimester free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels and pregnancy complications as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 2,110 non-smoking women with chromosomal and structurally normal fetuses at low-risk for both Down's syndrome (risk <1:250) and neural tube defects (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein <2.0 MoM). A free beta-hCG value of > or =2.0 MoM was used to define the populations with elevated levels of free beta-hCG. Descriptive statistics, chi2 test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean maternal age of the study group was significantly lower than in controls (27.9 +/- 4.3 and 30.6 +/- 5.1 years, respectively, p < 0.05), while the proportion of primigravidas was significantly higher compared to that of controls (p < 0.05). After adjustment of the 2 groups according to maternal age and parity, we observed an increased incidence of preeclampsia among women with elevated free beta-hCG levels in relation to controls (p < 0.05). However, a logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the free beta-hCG level was not a predictor of the occurrence of preeclampsia. No significant relationship was found with the incidence of gestational diabetes, oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, pregnancy-related hypertension, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion and stillbirths (p > 0.05).
