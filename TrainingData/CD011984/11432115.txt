Triple-test screening in in vitro fertilization pregnancies.
PURPOSE: To determine whether the results of triple-test analysis differ between spontaneous and IVF pregnancies. METHODS: The study population consisted of 140 women with singleton pregnancies, 70 by IVF, and 70 by spontaneous conception. The groups were matched for maternal age, gestational week, and laboratory batch. The levels of all triple-test markers--alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and unconjugated estriol (u-E3)--were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Significantly higher HCG levels were detected in the patients with IVF pregnancies than in the control group (1.31 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.5 multiple of the medians, respectively, (p < 0.006), but there were no significant differences in AFP or u-E3 levels. Overall, 18.5% of the IVF group were found to be screen-positive as compared with 11.4% of the control group (difference not statistically significant). Only 8 IVF pregnancies (11.4%) reached the lowest calculated risk possible (1:9999) compared with 17 (24.2%) in the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support previous data demonstrating elevated maternal serum HCG in IVF patients in comparison with spontaneous ones.
