First trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening for Down syndrome and other aneuploidies.
Low maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) values in the first trimester of pregnancy have been associated with an increased risk for chromosome disorders. In our own first trimester chorionic villus sampling (CVS) series, MSAFP determinations were carried out in 1,448 singleton pregnancies. Aneuploidies were detected in 26 of these. The pre-CVS MSAFP values in these pregnancies were compared to those in pregnancies with normal outcome. Statistical analysis did not show a diagnostically useful correlation between low first trimester MSAFP values and aneuploidy in our cohort.
