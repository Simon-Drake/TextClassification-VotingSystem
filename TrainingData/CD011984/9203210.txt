Fetal choroid plexus cysts--is a genetic evaluation indicated?
A study of the association between aneuploidy and fetal choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) is presented. By reviewing the world prospective and retrospective studies, one cannot reach an agreed conclusion since different study designs were used and meta analysis is not feasible. Our experience is that as a solitary ultrasonographic finding, genetic evaluation is not indicated in cases of CPC. However, all the 'risk factors' of fetal aneuploidy such as maternal age, biochemical markers, and ultrasonographic signs may create a score by which the indication for genetic evaluation will be more sound.
