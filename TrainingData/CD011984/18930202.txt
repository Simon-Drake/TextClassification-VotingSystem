Preimplantation genetic screening in a case of recurrent trisomy 21 offspring.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a unique case of recurrent aneuploidy and the use of preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Midwest academic medical center. PATIENT(S): A 36-year-old woman with two trisomy 21 offspring. INTERVENTION(S): Preimplantation genetic screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Karyotype of embryos, liveborn eukaryotic infant. RESULT(S): Preimplantation genetic screening was performed on three cryopreserved embryos, followed by a two-embryo transfer yielding a eukaryotic infant. CONCLUSION(S): Preimplantation genetic screening may prove to be useful as a diagnostic tool to help ensure a euploid pregnancy when termination is not a viable option for a couple.
