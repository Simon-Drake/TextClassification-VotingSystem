Fetal duodenal obstruction. A high risk indicator for Down's syndrome.
Seven cases of fetal duodenal obstruction were diagnosed during an ultrasound examination. In 5 out of the 7, Down's syndrome was later diagnosed. The finding of duodenal obstruction in a fetus is a high risk indicator for Down's syndrome. We therefore recommend prenatal cytogenetic examination to be performed in such cases.
