Screening for trisomy 21 in twin pregnancies in the first trimester using free beta-hCG and PAPP-A, combined with fetal nuchal translucency thickness.
In the first trimester of pregnancy the biochemical markers free beta-hCG and pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) are used for the prenatal screening of trisomy 21, either alone or in combination with nuchal translucency (NT) thickness. In this study, I have analysed the distribution of these biochemical markers in 159 twin pregnancies and compared this with 3466 singleton pregnancies. On average free beta-hCG values are 2.099 times greater in twins than in singletons and PAPP-A some 1.86 times greater. The width of the analyte distribution in twins is very similar to that in singleton pregnancies. Using statistical modelling techniques I have predicted that at a 5% false positive rate the detection rate in twins discordant for trisomy 21 will be 52% and in twins concordant for trisomy 21 will be 55%, if correction for twin pregnancy is carried out using the 'pseudo risk' approach. The detection rate using biochemical parameters is less than that achievable for twins using NT (75%). However, the combination of NT and maternal serum biochemistry will give detection rates approaching 80%. These rates are some 10% less than in singleton pregnancies, but nevertheless combining NT and biochemistry will allow high rates of detection of affected twins with the benefit of ultrasound and NT being able to specifically locate the affected twin. Twin screening using both modalities should be considered when introducing first trimester screening.
