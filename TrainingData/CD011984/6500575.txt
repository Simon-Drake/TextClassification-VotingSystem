The frequency of 47,+21,47,+18, and 47,+13 at the uppermost extremes of maternal ages: results on 56,094 fetuses studied prenatally and comparisons with data on livebirths.
We examined the proportions (or so called "rates") of fetuses with 47,+21, 47,+18, or 47,+13 diagnosed prenatally in women at the upper extremes of age. Our analysis was prompted by results from a large scale European study of amniocentesis which indicated that after increasing exponentially from age 35 years, the proportions of the autosomal trisomies reached a peak at a specific age and then leveled off or declined at the upper end of the age range. We analyzed North American data on 56,075 fetuses studied because of no known cytogenetic risk factor (aside from maternal age). This is the largest series to date. For 47,+21, the data from amniocentesis studies provide no evidence for any drop in the rate of change of proportion with maternal age up to 49 years. There is, if anything, a trend in our data to a steepening in the exponential rate of change at the upper extreme of age (above 46 years). Data from livebirths on the Down syndrome phenotype are at least consistent with an exponential rate of increase in proportion affected up to age 49 years. For 47,+18 our data from prenatal diagnoses are more consistent with an exponential increase up to age 43 years and a level proportion (or "rate") after that. For 47,+13 no cases were observed above age 42 years, consistent with the drop in proportion affected above this age observed in the European series. We emphasize the possible effect of sampling fluctuation and reporting error upon these apparent trends.
