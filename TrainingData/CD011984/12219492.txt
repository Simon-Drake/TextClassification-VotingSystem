[Preimplantation versus prenatal diagnosis--a comparison from the human genetics point of view].
This articles compares the most common techniques for prenatal diagnosis, amniocentesis and chorionic-villus sampling, with pre-implantation genetic diagnostics (PGD) with respect to the underlying indications, methodological aspects and safety. A major new indication for PGD in assisted reproduction is aneuploidy testing, which aims at transferring euploid embryos and increasing the pregnancy rate. The importance of adequate genetic counselling prior to PGD is stressed.
