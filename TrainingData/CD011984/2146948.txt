[Expansion of the physician's responsibility in patient education].
The Federal Supreme Court binds jointly treating physicians to mutual control. The further treating physician engages to inform his patients about misdiagnosis. Security information of the patient has priority over self protection and loyalty towards one's colleagues. However no common duty to denunciation of secure or supposed incorrect treatments is established.
