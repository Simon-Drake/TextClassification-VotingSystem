Best second trimester sonographic markers for the detection of trisomy 21.
We analyzed all genetic sonograms obtained during a 6 year period to establish the independent ability of the following sonographic markers of aneuploidy in the diagnosis of trisomy 21: structural anomalies, cardiac abnormalities, nuchal fold thickness of 6 mm or greater, bowel echogenicity, choroid plexus cysts, and renal pyelectasis. With the exception of bowel echogenicity and choroid plexus cysts, the sonographic markers were more common in trisomy 21 than euploid fetuses (all P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that cardiac anomalies (odds ratio = 255; 95% confidence interval, 25, 2592), other structural anomalies (odds ratio = 25; 95% confidence interval, 6, 97), and nuchal fold thickness of 6 mm or greater (odds ratio = 13; 95% confidence interval, 3, 50) were the only independent predictors of trisomy 21. The false-positive rate and sensitivity were 5.3% (48 of 898) and 59.2% (13 of 22), respectively, when any of the sonographic markers significant at univariate analysis was considered, and 3.1% (28 of 898) and 54.5% (12 of 22), respectively, when any of the predictors at multivariate analysis was present. Because a considerable overlap of sonographic markers exists among trisomy 21 fetuses, use of those that are not independent predictors leads to an increase in false-positive rate without a gain in sensitivity.
