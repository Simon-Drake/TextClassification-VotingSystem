Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease with testing for age-related aneuploidies.
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked recessive demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, caused by mutations of the proteolipid protein 1 gene (PLP1 gene). As no specific therapy is available for PMD, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) may be a useful option for couples carrying this mutation. PGD was performed for a couple who had had one child with the L86P mutation in exon 3 of the PLP1 gene. Because of advanced maternal age, PGD for this single-gene disorder was performed together with testing for chromosomal abnormalities. Polar bodies and blastomeres were tested for the presence of maternal mutation and closely linked markers DXS8020 and PLP5' (CA)n. The same blastomeres were also tested for the copy number of chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y, and five chromosomally abnormal embryos were identified. A total of three embryos predicted to be unaffected and free of chromosomal disorder were transferred back to the patient, resulting in a twin pregnancy and the birth of two healthy female infants confirmed to be free of PMD, representing the first PGD for PMD combined with aneuploidy testing.
