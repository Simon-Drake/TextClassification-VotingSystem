Perinatal outcome of prenatally diagnosed congenital talipes equinovarus.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the perinatal outcome of prenatally diagnosed congenital talipes equinovarus. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of all cases of prenatally diagnosed congenital talipes equinovarus referred to a major tertiary fetal medicine unit. Cases were identified from the fetal medicine and obstetric databases and pregnancy details and delivery outcome data obtained. Details of termination of pregnancy, number of patients undergoing karyotyping as well as details of prenatal classification of severity were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 174 cases were identified. Of these, outcome data was available for 88.5% (154/174) of the pregnancies. Eighty three (47.7%) of cases were isolated and 91 cases (52.3%) were associated with additional abnormalities. There was a significant difference in birth weights between the two cohorts. Bilateral abnormality tended to be more severe. A high caesarean section rate was noted overall and a high preterm delivery rate seen in the isolated group. CONCLUSION: This study is important because it provides contemporary data that can be used to counsel women prenatally. In particular, the raised risk of preterm delivery and caesarean section as well as the increased severity of the condition when both feet are affected should be discussed. The poor perinatal outcome when additional anomalies are present and the increased risk of aneuploidy are also important factors.
