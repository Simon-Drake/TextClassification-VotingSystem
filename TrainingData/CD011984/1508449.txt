Chorionic villus sampling in Auckland 1989-90.
AIMS: to perform an audit of all 197 chorionic villus sampling procedures performed in Auckland in 1989-90. METHOD: an attempt to trace the outcome in all 197 cases and this was possible in 188 cases. RESULTS: 89% of chorionic villus samples were performed transvaginally and 11% transabdominally. The total fetal loss rate was 9.6% (18) with six spontaneous miscarriages before 20 weeks gestation (3.2%), one intermediate fetal death and one neonatal death. There were 10 elective terminations of pregnancy following abnormal results so the spontaneous loss rate was 4.3%. CONCLUSIONS: the loss rate was lower than that reported in the European and Canadian multicentre trials. The sampling success rate, however, was poor with 13.7% failed procedures. This improved in the second year of the service to 10%. There were no failure cultures or examples of mosaicism.
