Proteomic evaluation of intermediary metabolism enzyme proteins in fetal Down's syndrome cerebral cortex.
Trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) is the most common genetic cause of human mental retardation. In Down's syndrome (DS) patients, deteriorated glucose, lipid, purine, folate and methionine/homocysteine metabolism has been reported. In our study, we used a proteomic approach to evaluate protein expression of enzyme proteins of intermediary metabolism in the brain of Down's syndrome fetuses. In fetal DS brain, we detected increased protein levels of mitochondrial aconitase as well as NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, decreased protein expression of citrate synthase and cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase. From two spots that corresponded to either pyruvate kinase M1 or M2 isozymes, significant elevation was observed only in one, while the second spot as well as the sum of the spots showed no differences between DS and controls. These results suggest derangement of intermediary metabolism during prenatal development of DS individuals.
