[The client's viewpoint on genetic counseling. Acceptability of the service in a Bolognese community (Castel San Pietro Terme)].
It has been found that the public's knowledge of genetic diseases and their prevention was extremely limited in the Commune of Castel San Pietro Terme (Bologna). This lack of information was common to all categories covered by the poll. In spite of this, the public was generally in favour of a genetic consultancy service. Overall figures reveal that 84.06% of men and 79.58% of women interviewed would use the information provided by genetic consultancy for preventive purposes.
