Cystic hygromata in trisomy 18 and 21.
Prenatal diagnosis of cystic hygromata by means of ultrasound examination is possible and highly accurate. Although this is usually associated with Turner's syndrome especially if there is co-existent hydrops fetalis we report three cases in which cystic hygromata were associated with trisomies; two cases of trisomy 21 and one of trisomy 18.
