Comparative genomic hybridization: a new tool for reproductive pathology.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the effectiveness of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for analysis of reproductive pathology specimens in clinical cytogenetics laboratories. DESIGN: A total of 856 CGH analyses were performed on various placental and fetal tissues derived from 368 specimens of spontaneous abortions and on placentas from 219 pregnancies with live-born infants. The live-born infants were clinically evaluated as normally developed, with either a normal birth weight or with intrauterine growth restriction; some live-born infants had an abnormal prenatal triple screen with normal cytogenetic results on amniotic fluid cell cultures. RESULTS: Comparative genomic hybridization analysis was successfully performed on 856 samples from spontaneously aborted specimens and term placentas. Failure of analysis occurred in 1.6% of samples and was due to an insufficient amount of tissue for DNA extraction. Comparative genomic hybridization identified aneuploidy in 53% of spontaneous abortion samples and 3.1% of term placentas. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative genomic hybridization analysis is a useful clinical tool for detection of aneuploidy in placental and fetal tissues. It provides a genome-wide screen while eliminating tissue culture failures, culture artifacts, and maternal cell contamination. We present practical guidelines for interpreting CGH profiles derived from human reproductive specimens.
