Maternal anxiety and ultrasound markers for aneuploidy in a multiethnic population.
OBJECTIVE: Discussion of isolated ultrasound (US) markers for fetal aneuploidy can provoke significant patient anxiety. The objective of this study is to quantify maternal anxiety associated with the detection of these markers. METHODS: All patients undergoing routine second-trimester US examination for fetal anatomical survey over a one-year period were administered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for Adults before and after the procedure. Women with isolated fetal markers for aneuploidy were notified of the findings but discouraged from pursuing amniocentesis. Rates of normal US examination, aneuploidy markers, anomalies, amniocentesis, and pregnancy outcomes were assessed across the ethnic groups. Pre- and post-ultrasound STAI surveys were scored and standardized with previously established norms. Student t-tests, Chi-square, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used where appropriate. RESULTS: Among the 798 patients tested, 57% were Hispanic, 30% were Asian, 6% were Black, and 7% were White. Maternal anxiety level was decreased in women after a normal US. The anxiety level increased with aneuploidy markers and was the highest with anomalies. Aneuploidy markers were more common among Hispanic and Asian fetuses, without any associated aneuploidy. Women with isolated aneuploidy markers underwent amniocentesis as often as women with advanced maternal age. CONCLUSION: The detection and communication of isolated aneuploidy markers is associated with increased maternal anxiety and unnecessary amniocentesis.
