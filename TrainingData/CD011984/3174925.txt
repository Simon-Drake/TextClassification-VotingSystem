Pregnancy and lupus: prognostic indicators and response to treatment.
A cohort study was undertaken of 18 consecutive pregnancies in 16 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus without significant renal impairment. Of these, eight each had at least two previously unexplained pregnancy failures, 10 had elevated anticardiolipin antibodies, nine had the lupus anticoagulant and five had antibodies to Ro. Twelve live births resulted but a Downs syndrome baby died in the perinatal period. Fetal morbidity was confined to four cases of fetal growth retardation, all in mothers positive for anticardiolipin antibodies, and fetal distress in another two. There were no cases of the neonatal lupus syndrome. There was one maternal death. An obstetric history of at least two previously unexplained pregnancy failures and the presence of maternal anticardiolipin or anti-Ro antibodies accurately predicted fetal loss in six of seven cases. No other serological risk factors for fetal loss were identified. We were unable to show that suppression of antibodies in those mothers with at least two previously unexplained pregnancy failures improved fetal outcome.
