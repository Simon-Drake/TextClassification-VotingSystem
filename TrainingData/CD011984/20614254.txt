Normative curves of fetal nasal bone length for the ethnic Chinese population.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the association between fetal nasal bone length (NBL) and gestational age (GA), biparietal diameter (BPD) and head circumference (HC) in women undergoing prenatal assessments and Down syndrome screening. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from 3,003 women with singleton pregnancies who underwent a prenatal ultrasound examination at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Cheng Hsin General Hospital between August 2006 and July 2009. RESULTS: Statistical analyses involved linear regression. NBL with GA, BPD and HC as measured between 14(+0) and 35(+6) weeks of gestation were linearly related. CONCLUSIONS: Using multiple parameters (GA, BPD and HC) to estimate NBL is more accurate than using than using GA or BPD or HC alone, as indicated by the higher predictive value.
