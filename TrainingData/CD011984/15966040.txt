Weight adjustment of serum markers in early first-trimester prenatal screening for Down syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether existing weight correction formulas for PAPP-A and free-beta-hCG developed for weeks 11 to 14 can be applied to pregnancies in weeks 8 to 10. METHODS: Development of formulas based on limited data sets of 8- to 10-week pregnancies and comparison with existing formulas. Calculation of median MoMs adjusted with different formulas for weight correction. RESULTS: Weight correction formulas for the gestational age of 11 to 14 weeks were not appropriate in the 8- to 10-week gestational age interval for PAPP-A, whereas existing weight correction formulas could be applied to free-beta-hCG, independent of gestational age interval. CONCLUSION: If PAPP-A is used in different gestational age intervals, weight corrections should be developed for the interval.
