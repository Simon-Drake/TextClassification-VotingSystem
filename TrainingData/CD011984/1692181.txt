Prenatal diagnosis of Pallister-Killian syndrome.
We describe a case of Pallister-Killian syndrome ascertained by routine amniocentesis as i(12p). The i(12p) was also found in 4 tissues of the aborted fetus, where various degrees of mosaicism 46/47 + i(12p) were seen. Although autopsy showed no major malformations, some of the minor anomalies of Pallister-Killian syndrome were found.
