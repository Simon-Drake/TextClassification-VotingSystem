Twin pregnancy with a chimeric androgenetic and biparental placenta in one twin displaying placental mesenchymal dysplasia phenotype.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to report an unusual trizygotic pregnancy that resulted in live-born twins. The placenta of one twin had placental mesenchymal dysplasia (PMD), which resulted from a chimeric fusion of an androgenetic zygote and a normal biparental zygote. The literature review was summarized. METHODS: The case was first detected by prenatal ultrasound, and was then followed by a histologic and detailed genetic investigation. The literature on PMD, complete hydatidiform moles (CHMs), and placental mosaicism and chimerism was also reviewed. RESULTS: One placenta of a twin pregnancy was noted to be diffusely cystic and enlarged. The macroscopic and microscopic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of PMD; however, genetic findings confirmed confined placental chimerism involving a normal biparental 46,XY male conceptus and an androgenetic 46,XX complete hydatidiform mole. CONCLUSIONS: This case represents a rare placental abnormality, PMD, which may have a diverse etiology. Therefore, detailed histologic and genetic analysis were performed for an accurate diagnosis.
