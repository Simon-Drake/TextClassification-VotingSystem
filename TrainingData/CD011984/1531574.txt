Bilateral choroid plexus cysts in trisomy 21.
Whether karyotyping is indicated in a fetus with choroid plexus cysts who is otherwise structurally normal is still controversial. Many authors have suggested basing the decision on cyst size, bilaterality, persistence with advancing gestational age, and association with other anomalies. We report a case of large bilateral choroid plexus cysts in a fetus with trisomy 21 who had no evidence of congenital anomalies or ultrasonographic signs of Down syndrome. Cyst sizes diminished by half over a 3-week period of follow-up. It appears that diminishing size alone should not be considered sufficient reassurance about the normality of the fetal karyotype. A similar case has been previously reported, and it is conceivable that choroid plexus cysts are associated not only with trisomy 18 but also with trisomy 21.
