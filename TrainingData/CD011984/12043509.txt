[Molecular genetic testing in amniotic fluid].
The recent progress in cloning and sequencing the genes responsible for genetic diseases and the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) allow to test genetic diseases with a few quantity of DNA. Amniotic cells are easily sampled by using amniocentesis. When abnormal ultrasound allows to suspect a genetic disease, PCR on DNA from amniotic cells is a very efficient test to confirm or exclude the presence of the disease. Microsatellites sequences can be used on amniotic cells as a rapid test for chromosomal aneuploidies.
