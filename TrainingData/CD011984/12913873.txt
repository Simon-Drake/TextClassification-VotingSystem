Sequential FISH analysis of oocytes and polar bodies reveals aneuploidy mechanisms.
OBJECTIVES: Constitutional aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of recognised pregnancies, with apparent preferential involvement of the X chromosome and the smaller autosomes. Molecular cytogenetic investigations of cleavage-stage embryos have revealed anomalies affecting all sizes of chromosomes. The aim was to investigate the variety of anomalies arising during maternal meiosis I by analysis of unfertilised oocytes and polar bodies to gain insight into aneuploidy mechanisms. METHODS: Sequential FISH analysis was carried out with specific probes derived from eight chromosomes, representing all sizes. Only imbalance due to a gain of a whole chromosome or chromatid, represented by extra signals, was counted to avoid artefact. RESULTS: Data were obtained on 236 eggs from 124 patients of average age 32.5 years (range 22-44). Ten patients (average 32.6 years) had abnormal eggs. The abnormality rate for oocytes and for polar bodies was close to 4% for each. Fourteen hyperploidies were found, seven involving additional single chromatids. The abnormalities affected chromosomes 13,16,18, 21 and X but not chromosomes 1, 9 or 12. CONCLUSION: The data provide evidence for several mechanisms leading to aneuploidy, including classical non-disjunction of whole univalents; pre-division of chromatids prior to anaphase I, leading to imbalance detected at metaphase II; gonadal mosaicism for a trisomic cell line and preferential involvement of the smaller chromosomes. Monosomy for the large autosomes is not uncommon in cleavage-stage embryos and may additionally arise from anaphase lag preferentially affecting such chromosomes.
