The prognostic factors and the outcome of primary isolated fetal ascites.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic factors and review the outcome of primary isolated fetal ascites. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted for fetuses with primary isolated ascites with a prenatal diagnosis between 1994 and 2009. The patients were divided into the favorable group (Group I) whose ascites were resolved by medical treatment alone and an unfavorable group (Group II) who required surgical intervention after birth due to refractory ascites. RESULTS: There were seven patients in Group I and five patients in Group II. Six of seven patients who developed ascites after 30 weeks' gestation were categorized in Group I, and four of five infants who developed ascites before 30 weeks' gestation were categorized in Group II. There was a negative correlation between the gestational age at diagnosis and the severity of the fetal abdominal distention. In Group II, the ascites resolved in two cases and was reaccommodated in another two cases after surgery. An infant with trisomy 21 received continuous drainage and eventually died of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of primary isolated fetal ascites can be predicted based on the gestational age at diagnosis and the severity of the fetal abdominal distention.
