Trisomy 20 mosaicism.
A further case of trisomy 20 mosaicism found at amniocentesis is presented. Pregnancy was terminated, the fetus showed facial dysmorphia and minor cardial and renal anomalies. 19 published reports of true trisomy 20 mosaicism at amniocentesis are reviewed. Five pregnancies resulted in obviously normal newborns. The significance of mostly minor anomalies found at autopsy of 7 fetuses remains unclear. With regard to genetic counselling the significance of trisomy 20 mosaicism is summarized as follows: (1) true trisomy 20 mosaicism in amniotic fluid cells reflects mosaicism of the fetus; (2) severe malformation is not a major feature of trisomy 20 mosaicism; (3) the risk of mental retardation is still undetermined, due to limited experience. However, there is no definite proof that the condition is harmful at all.
