First-trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities by fetal nuchal translucency in a Brazilian population.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities using nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in a Brazilian population. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 2996 singleton pregnancies with a live fetus at 10-14 weeks of gestation attending for routine antenatal care in a teaching hospital in Brazil. Fetal crown-rump length (CRL) and NT thickness were measured and the risks for trisomy 21 were calculated by a combination of maternal age and fetal NT with the use of software provided by The Fetal Medicine Foundation. Sensitivity and positive predictive values for different risk cut-offs were calculated. RESULTS: Chromosomal defects were diagnosed in 22 cases, including 10 cases of trisomy 21. The estimated risk based on maternal age and fetal NT was 1 in 300 or greater in 222 (7.4%) cases and these included nine of 10 (90.0%) pregnancies with trisomy 21 and nine of 12 (75.0%) pregnancies with other chromosomal defects. The NT was above the 95th centile in 5.8% of cases and this group included 70% of the trisomy 21 cases. CONCLUSION: A combination of maternal age and fetal NT provides an effective method of screening for chromosomal defects. The performance of the test in a Brazilian population is similar to that in Britain.
