[Puncture of the chorionic villi. Technic--experiences--risks].
Chorion villi biopsy is a recently introduced method for first trimester prenatal diagnosis. Based on 435 cases of chorionic villi biopsies, obtained during a 3 year period, we report our experiences with the technique of chorionic villi sampling, chromosomal analysis from trophoblast tissue and possibly associated complications, such as spontaneous abortions, vaginal bleeding, and chromosomal mosaicism. The rate of spontaneous abortions in our group of patients was 3%. This appears low, considering the high overall spontaneous abortion rate in early pregnancy of women over 35 years. The cytogenetic diagnosis is complicated by a high rate (2.8%) of chromosomal mosaicism, which were found to be not representative for the fetus, but required control amniocentesis. From our experiences with this method we conclude that chorion villi biopsy can be offered as a reliable alternative method to amniocentesis in the hands of an experienced team of obstetric surgeons and cytogenetists.
