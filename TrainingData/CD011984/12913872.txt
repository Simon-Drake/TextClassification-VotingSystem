Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities: implications from the outcome for couples with chromosomal rearrangements.
OBJECTIVES: Chromosomal rearrangements can lead to infertility or repeated spontaneous or induced abortions. The use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) allows the selected transfer of chromosomally balanced embryos. The aim of this study was to carry out detailed analysis of the outcome of 11 PGD cycles for 8 patients carrying various chromosomal rearrangements. METHODS: Patients underwent routine in vitro fertilisation with biopsy of embryos on day 3. Specific fluorescent in situ hybridisation protocols were developed for each couple. Embryo transfer was possible in all 11 cycles. RESULTS: The outcome was four pregnancies, leading to three live births and one biochemical pregnancy. Post-zygotic mosaicism was detected in 75% of untransferred embryos, the majority of which were chaotic. Detailed follow-up and analysis provided evidence for the co-existence of chromosomally balanced and abnormal cells in six embryos. The mechanisms involved included chromosome breakage and loss of material. CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy and analysis of two blastomeres, where possible, reduced the risk of misdiagnosis in cases of balanced/aneuploid mosaics. The three live births achieved for the eight couples treated in this series, despite the poor history in almost all cases, is further proof that a policy of biopsying two cells from embryos consisting of six or more cells and a single cell from four- or five-cell embryos is compatible with a positive outcome.
