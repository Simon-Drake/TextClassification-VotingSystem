Hyperglycosylated hCG: a variant with separate biological functions to regular hCG.
Hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H) is an over-glycosylated variant of hCG. While regular hCG is produced by differentiated syncytotrophoblast cells, hCG-H is independently secreted by stem cytotrophoblast cells. hCG-H has an independent function to regular hCG. It is the direct promoter of trophoblast invasion and malignancy. Invasion as in implantation of pregnancy and malignancy as in choriocarcinoma. Neither will occur in the absence of hCG-H. hCG-H measurements have multiple functions. Primarily or exclusively hCG-H is produced at the time of implantation of pregnancy and in the 2 weeks that follows. As such, a good pregnancy test should measure regular hCG and hCG-H equally. This is not commonly the case. Most tests poorly detect hCG-H. New pregnancy tests are needed, including those that measure only hCG-H. Considering that hCG-H is critical for implantation, hCG-H is also invaluable for determining pregnancy outcome and detecting failures. It makes a considerable more accurate test for detecting pregnancy failures and ectopic pregnancies than regular hCG. Down syndrome pregnancies are marked by poor trophoblast differentiation. As such, they are very well marked by using a combination of hCG-H measurements and other screening tests. hCG-H is also an absolute tumor marker for malignant or invasive gestational trophoblastic disease, it can discriminate active and inactive (quiescent) disease, and the need for chemotherapy.
