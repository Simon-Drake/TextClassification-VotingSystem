Increased nuchal translucency and decreased fetomaternal transfusion after chorionic villus sampling.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between nuchal translucency (NT) and fetomaternal transfusion (FMT) after chorionic villus sampling (CVS). METHODS: The level of FMT was determined in 272 viable, singleton pregnancies in which 10-14-week ultrasound scanning, NT measurement and CVS for fetal karyotyping had been performed. The pre-CVS NT was measured transvaginally, and the women were divided into two groups, i.e. those with NT < 2.5 mm (Group 1) or >or= 2.5 mm (Group 2). The level of FMT was determined via the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels before and after CVS. FMT was analyzed in relation to the pre-CVS NT. RESULTS: Of the 272 pregnancies, 213 were in Group 1 and 59 in Group 2. The mean levels of FMT after CVS were 23.3 +/- 12.2 and 5.4 +/- 2.9 micro L in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (P < 0.01). An FMT > 100 micro L was found in 19 cases in Group 1, whereas the maximum in Group 2 was 67.2 micro L. Aneuploidies were diagnosed in 17 cases, 15 (88.2%) of them in Group 2. When the pregnancies with adverse outcome were excluded from the two groups, a higher level of FMT was observed in Subgroup 1 than in Subgroup 2 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The mean level of FMT after CVS was significantly lower in pregnancies with an increased pre-CVS NT, a relationship observed in euploid pregnancies also. An increased pre-CVS NT seems to be inversely correlated with the FMT increase after CVS. Further studies are planned to investigate the background to this phenomenon.
