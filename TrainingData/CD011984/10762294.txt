The development of a sialic acid specific lectin-immunoassay for the measurement of human chorionic gonadotrophin glycoforms in serum and its application in normal and Down's syndrome pregnancies.
OBJECTIVE: We have developed and validated a lectin-immunoassay for the recognition of sialic acid residues on hCG glycoforms in serum. DESIGN: This assay employs a hCG specific capture antibody and a sialic acid specific lectin (Wheat Germ Agglutinin) labelled with horse radish peroxidase. RESULTS: The standard curve covered hCG concentrations of 0-4000 IU/l (3rd IS for hCG, 75/537) with an analytical sensitivity of 1.0 IU/l. The within and between batch coefficient of variation was < 7% for all doses. Cross-reactivity of < 1% with TSH, LH, FSH, hCGalpha, hCGbeta and desialylated hCG confirmed assay specificity. Dilutions of serum of < 10% final concentration were parallel to the standard curve (within and between batch CV, < 6%). The assay working range was 100 - > 500 000 IU/l and the recovery of hCG from serum was in the range of 94.5% to 115.4%, with a mean value of 102.1%. The assay detected a time dependent change in hCG sialylation during normal pregnancy with the relative abundance of sialylated hCG declining after week 9 and increasing after week 15 of gestation. In addition preliminary studies showed that maternal serum hCG concentrations measured with the lectin-immunoassay were elevated in high risk Down's pregnancies (as defined by conventional screening tests between weeks 16-18 gestation, median multiple of median, 3.14; range 1.81-19.12, P < 0. 001) and low risk (1.57, 0.49-6.14, P = 0.034) compared to normal (1. 00, 0.32-3.20) pregnancies. Furthermore, the lectin immunoassay had greater discriminatory power compared to conventional immunoassay of hCG and hCGbeta between normal and both low and high risk Down's pregnancies. CONCLUSION: This assay will allow analysis of serum samples for the investigation of sialylated variants of hCG glycoforms in various pathological and physiological situations.
