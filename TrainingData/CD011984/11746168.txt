Double locus analysis of chromosome 21 for preimplantation genetic diagnosis of aneuploidy.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of numerical chromosome abnormalities significantly reduces spontaneous abortions and may increase pregnancy rates in women of advanced maternal age undergoing in vitro fertilization. However, the technique has an error rate of around 10% and trisomy 21 conceptions have occurred after PGD. To further reduce the risk of transferring trisomy 21 embryos to the patient, we designed a protocol that analyzes chromosome 21 twice by targeting two different loci. This protocol was applied to 388 embryos from 60 cycles of PGD of aneuploidy. The scoring criterion used was based on giving equal importance to both probe results. Of the 242 embryos diagnosed as abnormal, 125 were re-biopsied to assess the rate of false positives and false negatives of the protocol and their clinical relevance. The results of the present study showed no reduction in the overall fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) error rate for single cells. However, by using a different scoring criterion, the incidence of false negative can be reduced to 1.6% without missing any trisomy 21. In addition, the present study suggests that if two or more loci from the same chromosome could be simultaneously analyzed in single cells, errors caused by false monosomies could be reduced.
