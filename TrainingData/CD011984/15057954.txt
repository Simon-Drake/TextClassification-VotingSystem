Introduction of the QF-PCR analysis for the purposes of prenatal diagnosis in Bulgaria--estimation of applicability of 6 STR markers on chromosomes 21 and 18.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to estimate the observed heterozygosity and informativeness of 6 STR markers on chromosomes 18 and 21 in the Bulgarian population. We have evaluated the applicability of these markers used from other investigators for QF-PCR prenatal diagnosis of the most common autosomal aneuploidies in Bulgaria. METHODS: DNA samples (n = 486) were extracted from different fetal tissues (amniotic fluid cells, chorionic villus samples, and fetal tissue after abortions). PCR amplifications of 4 STR markers located on chromosome 21 (D21S11, D21S1411, D21S1270, and D21S1440) and 2 on chromosome 18 (D18S535 and D18S51) were performed. They were analysed on an automated sequencer, and the allele dosage ratios were calculated. RESULTS: The results indicate the selected markers as highly informative for our population and suitable for QF-PCR prenatal diagnosis in Bulgaria. All samples with trisomy 21 (n = 8), trisomy 18 (n = 4) and triploidy (n = 1) were correctly detected by our analysis. Thus, no false-negative results were observed. CONCLUSION: QF-PCR analysis could be an applicable alternative in prenatal and postnatal diagnosis in cases with a strong suspicion for particular autosomal aneuploidies (including chromosomes 21, 18, and 13) in small countries with limited resources like Bulgaria.
