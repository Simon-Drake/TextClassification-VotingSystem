Patient with trisomy 6 mosaicism.
Trisomy 6 and trisomy 6 mosaicism were found in chorionic villi cell culture and short term incubation in a prenatal diagnosis at 12 weeks of gestation in a pregnancy with a growth retarded fetus showing nuchal translucency. The child was born in the 25th gestational week with a number of malformations including heart defects, deep-set ears, cleft right hand, cutaneous syndactylies, and overlapping toes of irregular shape and length. Trisomy 6 was not found in peripheral blood lymphocytes but was confirmed in umbilical cord fibroblasts. Currently, at the age of 2-3/4 years, the development of the child is relatively normal despite considerable growth delay. At the age of two years, she developed a papular erythema clinically suggestive of epidermal nevi. Cytogenetic analysis of fibroblast cultures derived from skin from a right hand finger and the inguinal area confirmed the presence of a trisomy 6 mosaicism. This is the first observation of a liveborn with trisomy 6 mosaicism.
