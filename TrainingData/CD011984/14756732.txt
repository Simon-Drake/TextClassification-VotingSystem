Plasma homocysteine in early and late pregnancies complicated with preeclampsia and isolated intrauterine growth restriction.
BACKGROUND: Elevated circulating homocysteine is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Increased homocysteine plasma levels have been reported to occur in approximately 20-30% of women with preeclampsia and it has been suggested that they may predict the subsequent development of preeclampsia. METHODS: In a cohort of 1874 pregnant women followed longitudinally, who participated in the Down screening program, 27 developed preeclampsia and 36 intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). A control group of 63 uneventful pregnancies was selected. Plasma homocysteine was assayed in the early second trimester and at delivery in all groups. Data were compared with Wilcoxon's matched-pair test. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference of plasma homocysteine between controls and preeclamptic or IUGR pregnancies in the early second trimester were found. There was a significant difference, only at delivery, between the preeclamptic subjects and the controls. CONCLUSIONS: We failed to demonstrate a plasma homocysteine predictive value in pregnancies subsequently complicated by preeclampsia and IUGR. As previously stated, we found that an elevated homocysteine plasma level is associated with overt preeclampsia.
