Chromosome 21 detection in human oocyte fluorescence in situ hybridization: possible effect of maternal age.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate, among 100 uncleaved oocytes, the incidence of numerical and structural chromosome 21 and X abnormalities and to analyze the influence of various factors, such as in vitro (IVF) indications, follicle stimulation protocols, and women's age. METHODS: We investigated 150 uncleaved oocytes from 128 patients after an IVF attempt. After cytogenetic analysis (Giemsa) 100 oocytes (66%) were selected for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Fluorescent probes for human chromosomes X and 21 were used simultaneously according to standard procedures for their hybridization and detection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed by the FISH protocol 100 metaphase II oocytes with 22 to 25 chromosomes. Our results demonstrate a high rate of disomy for chromosome 21 in human oocytes. Among them, eight were disomic (8%) and three were nullosomic (3%) for chromosome 21. Only one disomy of chromosome X was noted. The various indications of IVF and the different folliculogenesis stimulating protocols did not seem to influence the results but suggested a correlation between the maternal age and the aneuploidy rate of chromosome 21.
