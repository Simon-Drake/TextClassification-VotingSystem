Maternal serum ADAM12s as a marker of rare aneuploidies in the first or second trimester of pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the maternal serum ADAM12s concentrations are altered in the first and second trimester of pregnancies complicated by rare aneuploides. METHODS: ADAM12s was measured by a semi-automated time-resolved immunofluorometric assay in a series of 60 first-trimester cases with trisomy 13, 78 first-trimester cases with Turner's syndrome, 38 first-trimester cases with triploidy and 24 first-trimester cases with sex aneuploidy-the cases were compared with the data from 389 first-trimester controls. In the second trimester, a smaller number of 6, 7, 2 and 13 cases, respectively, were compared with the data from 341 controls. All data were expressed as multiple of the median (MoM) and corrected for maternal weight. Correlation with previously analysed markers (PAPP-A, free beta-hCG and delta NT) was performed. RESULTS: The first-trimester median MoM ADAM12s was significantly lower than 1.0 in all types of rare aneuploidy with the possible exception of triploidy type II. A significant positive correlation with gestational age was reported for trisomy 13 and Turner's syndrome. ADAM12s was not significantly correlated with any other first-trimester marker. In the second trimester, ADAM12s values were marginally increased in these rare aneuploidies. CONCLUSIONS: ADAM12s has already been shown to be a possible early first- and second-trimester marker of trisomies 21 and 18. Our data also show the possibility of levels of this marker being altered in the first and second trimester of pregnancies with rare aneuploidies. This may be a useful addition to screening strategies in the future.
