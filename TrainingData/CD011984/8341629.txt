Cytogenetic analysis of human oocytes after subzonal insemination.
Subzonal insemination has been proposed to achieve fertilization in cases where standard in vitro fertilization has failed. We present the results of chromosome analysis of oocytes after subzonal insemination. Our data suggest that the main cause (76 per cent) of the absence of cleavage after subzonal insemination is the total absence of sperm nucleus evolution of the injected spermatozoa. Our results also suggest that spermatozoa chromatin development is normal after subzonal insemination. Aneuploidy does not seem to be increased in zygotes after subzonal insemination. However, polyploidy was often more important than predicted by the observation of pronuclei (PN). Pronucleus development might be asynchronous and can appear earlier or later than after standard IVF. The cytogenetic risk after subzonal insemination might therefore be triploidy (if a triploid egg is transferred, because only 2 PN were seen) rather than aneuploidy or structural abnormalities.
