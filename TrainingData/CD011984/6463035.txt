United States survey on chromosome mosaicism and pseudomosaicism in prenatal diagnosis.
The survey of the incidence of chromosome mosaicism and pseudomosaicism detected in prenatal diagnosis included data from approximately 60 000 genetic amniocenteses in the United States. There were 59 participating cytogenetic laboratories nationwide. The overall incidence of chromosome mosaicism was 0.25 per cent (range of 0-0.89 per cent). The average frequency of pseudomosaicism involving multiple cells or clones was 0.7 per cent (range of 0-11.21 per cent). The frequency of single cell or clone pseudomosaicism was 2.47 per cent (range of 0-11.49 per cent). In cases of pseudomosaicism with trisomy, the most frequently involved chromosome was number 2; occurrence rates of trisomies 7,X,9,17 and 20 were also relatively high. In cases of pseudomosaicism with structural abnormalities, this survey showed an association between relative chromosome size and the frequency of involvement in structural rearrangement. Data on a total of 185 cases of chromosome mosaicism collected in this survey as well as from other documented sources showed 89 cases involved an autosome, 73 cases a sex chromosome, and 23 a marker chromosome. The frequency of noticeable phenotypic abnormalities was highest (37.8 per cent) in the autosomal mosaics and lowest (10.5 per cent) in the sex chromosome mosaics. The average rate for cytogenetic confirmation was 70 per cent.
