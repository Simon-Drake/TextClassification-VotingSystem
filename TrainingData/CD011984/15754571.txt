[Anterior abdominal wall defects--retrospective analysis of fetuses diagnosed in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology of the Postgraduate Center of Medical Education between 1997 & 2002].
OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine the risk of aneuploidy and anatomic anomalies in fetuses with different kinds of abdominal wall defects. DESIGN: We retrospectively studied ultrasound reports of the fetuses with abdominal wall defects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 108 cases diagnosed during the last five years in our center. All fetuses underwent a detailed ultrasonographic survey and in majority of cases (78.8%) antenatal karyotyping was performed. We also analyzed gestational age at the first examination. RESULTS: 35 cases presented gastroschisis, 60 omphalocele, 7 ectopia cordis and 6 limb-body wall complex. Associated anomalies were detected in 48.1% of all cases. It was 22.9% in gastroschisis group, 58.3% in omphalocele group, 42.9% in ectopia cordis group and in all fetuses with limb-body wall complex. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 13% of all cases; in 2.9% of gastroschisis group, 20% of omphalocele group, 16.7% of limb-body wall complex group and none of the fetuses with ectopia cordis. The median gestational age at the first examination was 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: In fetuses with abdominal wall defects detailed ultrasonographic survey and in majority of cases prenatal karyotyping should be done. Furthermore patients with fetus with such a defect should be diagnosed as early as possible in the referral center.
