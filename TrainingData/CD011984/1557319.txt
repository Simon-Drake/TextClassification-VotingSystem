Nature and frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancies with abnormal ultrasound findings: an analysis of 117 cases with review of the literature.
During a 7-year period, 117 fetal karyotypes were available from 131 genetic amniocenteses. These procedures were performed between 14 and 37 weeks' gestation for the following abnormal ultrasound findings: (1) intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)--61 cases; (2) fetal malformation--71 cases; and (3) amniotic fluid volume (AFV) abnormality--60 cases. Chromosomal abnormalities were identified in 19 cases (16.2 per cent). Aneuploidy was 2.5 times as frequent in the presence of malformations than in their absence. No correlation was demonstrated between specific fetal malformations and specific chromosomal abnormalities. Aneuploidy was also twice as frequent in the presence of symmetrical IUGR than in its absence. No chromosomal abnormalities were found among eight cases of asymmetrical IUGR. Four cases of aneuploidy presented with isolated IUGR, three of these involving the X chromosome. The frequency of aneuploidy was the same with or without abnormalities of AFV (14.3 versus 16.4 per cent). No chromosomal abnormality was found associated with isolated AFV abnormalities.
