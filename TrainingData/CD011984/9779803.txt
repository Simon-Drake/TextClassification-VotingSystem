Systematic search for uniparental disomy in early fetal losses: the results and a review of the literature.
About 20% of all human conceptuses are estimated to be trisomic and trisomy of all chromosomes remains a common cause of early fetal loss. Uniparental disomy (UPD) has been reported for most human chromosomes and may be an underrecognized contributor to embryonic lethality. To investigate the contribution of UPD to spontaneous abortions, we devised a genome-based screening strategy to identify holochromosomic UPD in 18 fetal losses. No cases of UPD were identified using this approach. Based on our data, UPD does not appear to be a significant contributor to early embryonic lethality. The results of the study are presented along with a review of the cases of UPD reported in the literature by chromosome, parental origin, mode of ascertainment, and phenotypic consequences due to imprinting.
