Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 20 by chorionic villus sampling (CVS): a case report with long-term outcome.
A case of prenatally diagnosed non-mosaic trisomy 20 in cells cultured from a chorionic villus sample (CVS)is presented. The term placental karyotype was also non-mosaic trisomy 20. The karyotype of the newborn was 46,XY/47,XY,+20 in foreskin cultures and in a second skin culture; blood lymphocyte culture was 46,XY. Aside from diffuse, hypopigmentary swirls along the lines of Blaschko observed on his extremities and trunk, referred to as hypomelanosis of Ito, the patient is clinically normal at 8 3/4 years of age. In addition, he is one of the oldest reported cases of mosaic trisomy 20 confirmed after birth for which the clinical outcome has been monitored. This case demonstrates that these trisomy 20 findings are compatible with normal psychomotor development and phenotype.
