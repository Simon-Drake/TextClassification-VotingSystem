A prospective study of the incidence and significance of fetal choroid plexus cysts.
Cysts of the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle can be detected in the fetus during routine scanning at 16-18 weeks' gestation with an approximate incident of one in every 120 pregnancies. It is likely that in a high percentage of cases cysts are bilateral and that their recent discovery is mainly due to improvements in imaging technology. Although the great majority of cases resolve and do not result in any morbidity, five cases of trisomy 18 and one case of trisomy 21 associated with fetal choroid plexus cysts have been reported. In this prospective study, choroid plexus cysts were detected in 42 fetuses, resulting in 40 normal infants and 2 cases of trisomy 18. It is concluded that there may be a relationship between fetal choroid plexus cysts and trisomy 18. In order to obtain a more precise and accurate result, a multi-centre prospective study is being organized.
