Free beta-chorionic gonadotropin: a cross-reactivity study of two immunometric assays used in prenatal maternal serum screening for Down's syndrome.
We have evaluated the cross-reactivity characteristics of two distinct immunometric assays for the measurement of free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (free beta). These maternal serum assays have been used in the initial studies which evaluated free beta as a marker in the prenatal detection of Down's syndrome. It has been suggested that free beta assays are subject to substantial potential for cross-reactivity. To confirm that free beta was the analyte responsible for enhanced detection efficiency both non-competitive and competitive cross-reactivity evaluations were undertaken. These studies demonstrated acceptably small cross-reactivity to other glycoprotein hormones or their beta components. We conclude that properly designed free beta assays will provide specific analyte measurement and improved detection efficiency in Down's syndrome screening.
