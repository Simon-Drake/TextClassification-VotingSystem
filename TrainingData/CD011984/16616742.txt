First successful pregnancy outcome after preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening in embryos generated from natural-cycle in vitro fertilization combined with an in vitro maturation procedure.
OBJECTIVE: To report on the first successful pregnancy performing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) on embryos obtained after combining natural IVF with in vitro maturation procedure. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): A 35-year-old patient with polycystic ovaries who was attending the fertility clinic. INTERVENTION(S): In vitro maturation of immature oocytes and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of aneuploidy screening in embryos produced from in vitro maturation procedure. RESULT(S): Thirteen immature and two mature oocytes were collected, and eight mature oocytes were normally fertilized, of which six embryos were biopsied for chromosome analysis. Two chromosomally normal embryos were transferred on day 5, resulting in the birth of a healthy child. CONCLUSION(S): This case report demonstrates that an acceptable number of embryos can be generated after in vitro maturation procedure to perform PGD for aneuploidy screening and that this approach can be extended to patients with polycystic ovaries or polycystic ovary syndrome who are undergoing PGD for other genetic diseases.
