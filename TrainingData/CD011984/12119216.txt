French multi-centric study of 2000 amniotic fluid interphase FISH analyses from high-risk pregnancies and review of the literature.
This prospective and multi-centric study confirms the accuracy and the limitations of interphase FISH and shows that any cytogenetics laboratory can perform this technique. With regard to the technical approach, we think that slides must be examined by two investigators, because the scoring may be subjective. The main problem with the AneuVysion kit concerns the alpha satellite probes, and especially the chromosome 18 probe, which is sometimes very difficult to interpret because of the high variability of the size of the spots, and this may lead to false negative and uninformative cases. The best solution would be to replace these probes by locus-specific probes. Concerning clinical management, we offer interphase FISH only in very high-risk pregnancies or/and at late gestational age because of the cost of the test. We think that an aberrant FISH result can be used for a clinical decision when it is associated with a corresponding abnormal ultrasound scan. In other cases, most of the time, we prefer to wait for the standard karyotype.
