[Chromosome abnormalities and congenital heart diseases: a retrospective on 49 cases].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between congenital heart diseases and chromosome abnormalities. METHODS: Patients with congenital heart diseases who underwent chromosome examinations during Jan 2006 and Dec. 2009 in the Center of Prenatal Diagnosis of Beijing University People's Hospital were recruited in the study. The association between chromosome karyotypes and types of congenital heart diseases was analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 49 patients with congenital heart diseases, trisomy 21 was established in 11 cases, trisomy 18 in 6 cases, trisomy 13 in 6 cases, trisomy 14 in 1 cases, trisomy 16 in 3 cases, trisomy 8 in 1 cases, trisomy 22 in 1 cases, sex chromosomal abnormalities in 8 cases, triploid in 2 cases, partial chromosomal trisomy in 8 cases, and 46,XX/XY, 5p-- in 2 cases. CONCLUSION: Chromosome abnormalities are associated with congenital heart diseases. Different abnormal chromosome karyotypes contribute to different types of congenital heart diseases. Prenatal chromosome examinations could be undertaken to detect congenital heart diseases.
