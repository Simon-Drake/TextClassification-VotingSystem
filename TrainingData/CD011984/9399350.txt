Elevated hCG as an isolated finding during the second trimester biochemical screen: genetic, ultrasonic, and perinatal significance.
This study was undertaken in an attempt to determine the significance of elevated maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin (MShCG), in the presence of an otherwise normal screen with respect to fetal malformations, chromosomal aberrations, and pregnancy outcome. Targeted ultrasound findings and perinatal outcome of 298 women in whom serum hCG was > or = 2.5 MOM and who were screen-negative for Down syndrome (the study group) were compared with a control group of 229 women in whom serum hCG as well as the other parameters were within the normal range. Genetic amniocentesis was performed in 125 women from the study group. Ultrasonically detected malformations were significantly more frequent among the study group (12 vs. 1, P = 0.01). Pregnancy complications were similar in the two groups, with the exception of pre-eclampsia-toxaemia, which was significantly more frequent in the study group (5 vs. 0, P = 0.02). There was one case of an abnormal karyotype (47,XXY). Although genetic amniocentesis does not appear warranted, isolated elevated MShCG levels during the second trimester screening was associated with an increased risk of fetal anomalies detected by ultrasound and of toxaemia of pregnancy.
