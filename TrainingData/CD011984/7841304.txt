Haemophilia A diagnosis by automated fluorescent DNA detection of ten factor VIII intron 13 dinucleotide repeat alleles.
Haemophilia A is a recessive X linked bleeding disorder caused by deficiency or functional abnormality of coagulation factor VIII. This disease usually has no visible phenotype in female carriers; hence, great efforts are made to offer all haemophilia A families accurate carrier diagnosis. Significant progress in this direction was made with the identification of the intron 13 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), which is hitherto the most informative single marker within the factor VIII gene. The authors have established intron 13 VNTR detection in their laboratory by adapting its analysis to an automated sequencer using different primers of which one is fluorescent dye labelled. With this method, which is more rapid and convenient than that originally described, 67 haemophilia A families of German origin were screened and two new alleles (alleles 17 and 25) were identified. The informativeness of the VNTR in these families based on the patients maternal X chromosomes (134) is about 67%.
