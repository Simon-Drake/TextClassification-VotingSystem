Pregnancy in patients with Turner's syndrome: six new cases and review of literature.
Pregnancy in women with Turner's syndrome (TS) is an exceptional event, but is possible in 2% of cases. It can occur in patients with structural anomalies of the X chromosomes in which the Xq13-q26 region, containing the genes that are thought to control ovarian function, is spared; or in patients with a mosaic karyotype containing an 46,XX cell line, which preserves ovarian function. In our Centre we observed six cases of women with Turner's syndrome conceiving. Out of 13 pregnancies, there were six abortions and eight live-births; among the latter, four babies exhibited malformations. Reviewing the literature shows that out of 160 pregnancies which occurred in 74 women with TS, 29% ended in spontaneous abortion, 7% led to the perinatal death of the fetus, 20% gave birth to malformed babies (TS, Down's syndrome, etc.) and only in 38% of cases were healthy children born. This study suggests that the rare TS patients who are able to procreate should undergo prenatal diagnosis techniques. In sterile TS patients the use of artificial fertilization techniques is a possible solution.
