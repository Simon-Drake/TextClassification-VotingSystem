The prenatal detection of genetic diseases has improved remarkably. This review highlights several diagnoses that are possible to identify by ultrasound examination of the fetus, including cystic fibrosis, skeletal dysplasias, kidney diseases, cardiac disease and central nervous system disorders. Ultrasound clues to the possible existence of several syndromes and aneuploidy are also outlined.
