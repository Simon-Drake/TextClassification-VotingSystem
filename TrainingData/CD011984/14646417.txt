Association of undetectable unconjugated estriol on multiple marker screening with steroid sulfatase deficiency.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether all patients with undetectable unconjugated estriol (uE3) on multiple marker screening (MMS) are carriers for steroid sulfatase (STS) deficiency. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 65 pregnancies with undetectable uE3 on MMS. RESULTS: Of the 65 pregnancies, there were 21 that continued, 40 spontaneous losses, 2 lost to follow-up and 2 elective terminations. Of the 21 continuing pregnancies, 15 were determined to be carriers of the STS deletion. Twenty-seven of the 40 pregnancy losses were associated with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP); about half of the losses were shown to have occurred prior to sampling. CONCLUSION: Patients with undetectable uE3 are likely to be carriers of the STS deletion, except those with associated elevated AFP. Elevated AFP with undetectable uE3 on MMS is a marker of preexisting or impending fetal demise.
