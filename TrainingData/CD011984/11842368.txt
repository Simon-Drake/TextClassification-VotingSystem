[Screening for aneuploidy by first trimester nuchal translucency measurement: results from a prospective trial including 1980 cases in a single center in Switzerland].
AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of first trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities using the sonographically determined thickness of nuchal translucency (NT) combined with maternal age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Risk screening was offered to all patients with a fetal crown rump length (CRL) between 45 and 84 mm after extensive counselling. For the risk assessment the software provided by the Fetal Medicine Foundation was used. In accordance with the recommendation of the Swiss Working Group on First Trimester Screening a cut-off risk of 1 : 400 was chosen. RESULTS: A total of 1980 consecutive pregnancies participating in the risk screening programme with due dates prior to May 1, 2001 were included. Mean maternal age was 30.1 yrs and 522 (26.4 %) patients were 35 yrs or older. A positive risk screening result was obtained in a total of 219 (11.1 %) pregnancies including 33 of the 37 (1.9 %) cases with unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate for unbalanced chromosome abnormalities in general (89.2 %) as well as the one for trisomy 21 (93.3 %) in particular are very high with a moderate false-positive rate (9.6 %) in this series. As a comparison in the series presented here, traditional "maternal age screening" (cut-off age 35 yrs) would have yielded detection rates of 64.9 % for all unbalanced chromosome abnormalities and 73.3 % for trisomy 21 at a false-positive rate of 25.0 %. Reducing the false-positive rate by raising the cut-off age to 38 yrs would yield detection rates of 40.5 % for all unbalanced chromosome abnormalities and 46.7 % for trisomy 21 at a false-positive rate of 8.9 %. The number of invasive procedures performed to detect one unbalanced chromosome count may be calculated as 21.75 using the cut-off age of 35 yrs as compared to 6.4 using NT measurement and maternal age. The outcome of this ongoing study is in good accordance with the earlier observation that the main benefit of the addition of first trimester NT measurements to the risk screening protocol is a very high detection rate at a moderate false-positive rate.
