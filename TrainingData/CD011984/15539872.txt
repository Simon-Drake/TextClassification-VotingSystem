Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 2 mosaicism: a case report.
We report a case of trisomy 2 mosaicism detected upon amniocentesis in a woman with advanced maternal age. A mos 47,XY,+2(4)/46,XY(21) karyotype was revealed using standard GTG banding. There were no pathological sonographic findings and the fetal size was normal for gestational age at 16th week. The use of serial high-resolution ultrasound examination of the fetus to detect major abnormalities was offered as an option to the parents who, however, decided for termination of the pregnancy. Fetal autopsy did not reveal any malformations. Trisomy 2 mosaicism is associated with variable phenotypic abnormalities without a specific pattern, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal demise or stillbirth. The rarity of trisomy-2 mosaicism in prenatal diagnosis, as well as the increased risk of an abnormal outcome makes the diagnostic approach and genetic counseling difficult.
