[Neonatal neoplasms: a single-centre experience].
INTRODUCTION: Malignant tumors are uncommon in the neonatal period and benign tumors may have malignant potential. OBJECTIVES: To describe the neoplasms diagnosed and treated in newborns (</= 28 days of life) in the Hospital Universitario de Canarias and their association with congenital abnormalities and to evaluate prenatal diagnosis of these tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients with neoplasms diagnosed during the neonatal period in the previous 25 years in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The variables analyzed were the percentage of neonatal neoplasms among the total number of cancer cases in children aged less than 14 years, their incidence among all the newborns in our hospital, sex, year of diagnosis, age at clinical diagnosis, the presence or absence of prenatal diagnosis, type of tumor (histologic diagnosis), association with syndromes or other congenital anomalies, treatment, and long-term outcome. RESULTS: Of 260 neoplasms diagnosed in our unit from 1980, 16 (6.1 %) were diagnosed in the neonatal period. The incidence of neonatal neoplasms was estimated to be 276.5 per million live births. Males accounted for 43.8 % and females for 56.2 %, with a mean age at diagnosis of 5.5 days (range 1-28 days). Five neonates (31.2 %) had a prenatal diagnosis, 60 % of which were made in the last 7 years of the study period. A further five newborns were diagnosed at the initial neonatal examination. Histologic diagnoses were neuroblastoma (n = 5; 31.2 %), teratoma/ germ cell tumor (n = 4; 25 %), soft tissue sarcoma (one fibrosarcoma of the thigh and two hemangiopericytoma of the back and heart; 18.8 %), and one case each of mesoblastic nephroma, cerebral tumor (ependymoblastoma), melanoma (associated with giant congenital melanocytic nevi), and acute leukemia (associated with Down syndrome). Treatment consisted of surgery alone (n = 10; 62.5 %) and surgery plus chemotherapy (n = 5; 31.2 %); one patient received no treatment. The overall actuarial survival rate was 87.5 %. Sequelae were observed in 33.3 % of survivors. CONCLUSIONS: The neoplasms most frequently diagnosed in the neonatal period were solid tumors, mainly neuroblastoma and teratomas/germ cell tumors; 12.5 % were associated with syndromes or congenital anomalies. In the last 7 years, the prenatal diagnosis of these entities has improved. Most of the neoplasms responded to therapy, mainly surgery, and long-term outcome was favorable.
