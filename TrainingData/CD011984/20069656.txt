Perinatal outcome following fetal chest shunt insertion for pleural effusion.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate perinatal outcome of fetuses with primary pleural effusions following pleuroamniotic shunting. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 88 fetuses with large pleural effusions referred to a tertiary fetal medicine unit between 1991 and 2008 which, after a thorough work-up, underwent pleuroamniotic shunting. RESULTS: At presentation, 59 (67.0%) fetuses were hydropic and 67 (76.1%) had bilateral effusions. In 17 (19.3%) fetuses, pleural fluid was aspirated prior to shunting and in 71 (80.7%), shunts were inserted directly as the first procedure. Mean gestational age at shunting was 27.6 (range, 18-37) weeks and at delivery 34.2 (range, 19-42) weeks. Seventy-four (84.1%) babies were born alive, of whom 52 (70.3%) survived the neonatal period. Of 59 hydropic fetuses, 10 (16.9%) died @ in utero and 18 neonates (30.5%) died, resulting in perinatal survival of 52.5%, whereas of 29 non-hydropic fetuses, perinatal survival was 72.4%. Hydrops resolved following shunting in 28 fetuses, of whom 71% survived, compared to 35% survival in 31 fetuses where hydrops persisted (P = 0.006). Of 22 neonatal deaths, seven were related to pulmonary hypoplasia, five to genetic syndromes, two to aneuploidy and one to a congenital anomaly (truncus arteriosus). Overall 13 (14.8%) were diagnosed with a chromosomal, genetic or other condition, several of which could not have been diagnosed antenatally. CONCLUSION: Carefully selected fetuses with primary pleural effusions can benefit from pleuroamniotic shunting, allowing hydrops to resolve with a survival rate of almost 60%.
