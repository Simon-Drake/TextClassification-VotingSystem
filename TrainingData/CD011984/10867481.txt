Discrepancy between cytogenetic and FISH results on an amniotic fluid sample of 45,X/46,X,idic(Y)(p11).
The presence of abnormal ultrasound markers showing a thick nuchal fold with short middle phalanx of the fifth finger in an otherwise normal-appearing female fetus led to the sampling of amniotic fluid at 16 weeks gestation. Cytogenetic analysis with routine G-banding showed a 45,X karyotype in all 20 cells analysed from two flasks. However, fluorescent in situ hybridization on uncultured cells showed presence of a Y signal in 9 cells, 11 cells showing a single signal for the X. A cytogenetic analysis of the fetal blood at 23 weeks confirmed the presence of two cell lines, 45,X and 46,X, idic(Y)(p11). The couple opted to have the pregnancy terminated. However, the fetus was not available to carry out confirmatory tests.
