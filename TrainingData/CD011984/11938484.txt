Down syndrome: still a social stigma.
Down Syndrome (DS) is a commonly occurring chromosomal abnormality. The incidence increases with advancing maternal age over 35 years. Over the last three decades, tremendous progress has been made in the medical and surgical treatment of these infants. Nationally, a great deal of resources are allocated to DS infants to improve their growth and development. Yet, the perception remains that the DS infant is still not openly accepted by parents and society, as illustrated by the presented cases. This lack of acceptance creates many complex ethical challenges in treating such babies, starting with fetal diagnosis of the disorder in the womb and moving through early stages after the birth of the baby. We argue that health professionals have the responsibility to help make public attitudes more accepting of Down Syndrome. Professionals should encourage social and community involvement of these children. The National Association for Down Syndrome should be contacted periodically to promote activities to enhance public awareness. To the end of greater acceptance, we suggest a ritual at birth that might improve the acceptance of the DS child into the family and the community and hence help improve social attitudes toward Down Syndrome.
