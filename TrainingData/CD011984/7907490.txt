Control of morphogenesis and differentiation by HOM/Hox genes.
HOM/Hox genes are master regulatory switches that specify axial identity and control the growth and differentiation of groups of cells related by position. HOM/Hox genes function combinatorially and hierarchically to specify cell fate. Some of the genes they regulate and that mediate specific identify functions have been identified. Research in Drosophila has shown that HOM genes are continuously required during development for correct axial identity.
