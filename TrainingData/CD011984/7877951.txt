Prenatal ultrasonic diagnosis of obstructive bowel disease: a retrospective analysis.
Fetal obstructive bowel disease was diagnosed in 29 patients at 22-37 weeks (median 32 weeks) of gestation, seven (24 per cent) of whom also displayed other anomalies. Polyhydramnios was present in 20/29 cases (69 per cent). An abnormal karyotype existed in 7/29 cases (24 per cent), of which six were diagnosed prenatally (trisomy 21, n = 5; 69,XXX, n = 1) and one postnatally (trisomy 21). There was always an association with the ultrasonic 'double bubble' sign. Obstructive bowel disease was confirmed postnatally in 20/29 (69 per cent) cases, i.e., oesophageal atresia (n = 1), duodenal obstruction (n = 12), and small bowel obstruction (n = 7). Other anomalies existed in 6/29 (21 per cent) cases, i.e., multicystic kidney (n = 1) and multiple congenital anomalies (n = 5). The perinatal mortality rate was 35 per cent (7/20).
