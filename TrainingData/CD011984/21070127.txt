Role of the vascular endothelial growth factor in the inverse relationship between increased nuchal translucency thickness and fetomaternal transfusion.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the possible etiological role of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the inverse correlation between nuchal translucency (NT) thickness and fetomaternal transfusion (FMT). METHODS: The level of FMT was determined prospectively in 80 viable, singleton pregnancies in which 10-14-week ultrasonographic scanning, NT thickness measurement; chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for fetal karyotyping and VEGF concentration determination were performed. The grouping procedures were based either on NT thickness (<2 MoM in Group I, and >/=2 MoM in Group II), or on karyotype (euploid in Group A, and aneuploid in Group B). The level of FMT was determined via maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels before and after CVS. The FMT and the VEGF concentration of the chorionic tissue were analysed in comparisons between Groups I and II, and between Groups "A" and "B". RESULTS: The mean level of FMT after CVS was 72.5+/-21.3 muL and 19.28+/-5.4 muL in Groups I (n=44) and II (n=36), respectively (P<0.02). The VEGF concentration of the chorionic tissue in Groups I and II was 40.6+/-16.7 pg/mg protein and 21.1+/-6.3 pg/mg protein, respectively (P=0.28). The mean level of FMT was 57.9+/-15.0 muL and 8.1+/-3.9 muL in Groups A and B, respectively (P<0.003). The VEGF concentration of the chorionic tissue in Groups A and B was 25.9+/-10.7 pg/mg protein and 21.3+/-11.3 pg/mg protein, respectively (P=0.77). CONCLUSION: No difference exists in the VEGF concentration in the aspirated chorionic tissue between Groups I and II and between Groups A and B. A higher level of FMT was observed among the aneuploid pregnancies after CVS than among the euploid cases. Chorionic VEGF does not influence the inverse relationship between the pre-CVS NT thickness and FMT.
