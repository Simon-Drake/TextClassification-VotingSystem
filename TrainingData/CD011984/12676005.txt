Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of numerical abnormalities for 13 chromosomes.
Several types of FISH protocols for PGD have been used to maximize results from a limited number of fluorochomes to study as many chromosomes as possible. The major purpose of the present study was to optimize the use of three sequential hybridizations to analyse up to 15 chromosome types in single cells. A secondary purpose was to study the frequency of aneuploidy of other chromosomes not yet extensively studied in preimplantation embryos. Patients underwent PGD of aneuploidy, and the biopsied cells were analysed with three sequential hybridizations, the first for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21 and 22, the second for X, Y, 15 and 17 and the third for 2, 3, 4 and 11. Overall, only 27% of embryos were normal. The chromosomes most involved in aneuploidy were, in order, chromosome 16, 15, 21, 22, 13, 18, 17, 3, 2, 4, 11, and gonosomes. Of the abnormal embryos, only 3% would have been missed without the third set of probes. This protocol allows the simultaneous analysis of up to 15 chromosomes although only 13 were analysed in this study. Results so far show that the chromosomes most involved in abnormalities are those already covered with the two first sets of probes.
