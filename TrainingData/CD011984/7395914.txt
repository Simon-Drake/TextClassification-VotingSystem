The ring nature of a tiny supernumerary chromosome fragment.
We report a 5 1/2-year-old girl with a tiny supernumerary chromosome fragment found in mosaic. The ring nature of the tiny fragment was demonstrated by the detection of the characteristic products of a ring chromosome. The clinical consequence of a ring chromosome and the impact of finding a supernumerary chromosome fragment, especially in the practice of prenatal chromosome diagnosis, are discussed.
