Description and molecular analysis of SRY and AR genes in a patient with 46,XY pure gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome).
46,XY pure gonadal dysgenesis, first described in 1955 by Swyer, results from testicular tissue loss during the first 8 weeks of fetal life, a critical period for male differentiation. We describe a case of an 18 years old patient presented to us with a chief complain of primary amenorrhea. Chromosomal analysis revealed a 46,XY karyotype. A molecular investigation was undertaken in an attempt to determine mutations in SRY and AR genes through DNA sequencing. Mutations were shown to be absent. The molecular basis of Swyer syndrome is still unknown, although the presence of mutations in testicular organizing genes downstream of SRY is still to rule out. The patient, who is considered as female, was placed on estrogen replacement therapy, while bilateral prophylactic laparoscopic gonadectomy was programmed due to the high prevalence of gonadal tumors in this syndrome. No signs of malignance were detected in the gonadal tissue, which predicts that an intact SRY gene is usually, but not always, not related to the formation of malignancies like dysgeminomas or gonadoblastomas.
