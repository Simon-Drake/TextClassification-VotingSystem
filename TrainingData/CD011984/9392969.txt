Maternal serum screening for Down's syndrome: a survey of midwives' views.
The lack of consensus regarding the implementation of maternal serum screening, has led to a widespread variation in practice. The importance of the role of midwives within the service has been recognised. All maternity units in the Northern region now have a designated 'co-ordinator' in an attempt to improve service delivery, professional liaison and training. This study was designed to obtain midwives' views about maternal serum screening in principle and to assess whether any changes had occurred since the introduction of co-ordinators. Semi-structured, postal questionnaires were sent to all midwives in one health authority for them to complete and return. Within this authority, one maternity unit offered universal screening whereas the other maintained a selective policy. Responses were obtained from 90 out of 133 (67.7%). There was almost unanimous support for the principle of screening 86 out of 90 (95.5%) and most midwives considered the offer of screening should be an NHS service, independent of age 78 out of 90 (86.7%). Half of the respondents 46 out of 90 (51.2%) reported that the introduction of a co-ordinator had been successful in improving staff education but requests for further training and updating were made by 69 out of 90 (76.6%) despite having had this organized training input: although those midwives who were regularly involved with screening made significantly fewer requests 27 out of 45 (60%). These findings confirmed our previous recommendation that ongoing responsibility for such provision would be required. The results of the study provided a useful contribution towards the review of screening policy undertaken by the health authority, as well as evidence upon which to base further development of the role of the co-ordinators in their support of midwives.
