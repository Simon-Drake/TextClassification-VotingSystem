Issues in analysis of data on paternal age and 47,+21: implications for genetic counseling for Down syndrome.
Data and analyses on paternal age and 47,+21 are reviewed. It is concluded that there are few, if any, grounds to justify the inference of a paternal age effect independent of maternal age for those paternal age-maternal age combinations on which there are prenatal diagnostic data. It is suggested that genetic counseling as to increased (or decreased) risk of Down syndrome associated with various paternal ages is not justified at present.
