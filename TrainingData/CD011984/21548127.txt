Balanced information about Down syndrome: what is essential?
The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of genetic counselors and parents of children with Down syndrome to define essential information for the initial discussion of a new diagnosis. We compared information given in both prenatal and postnatal settings, and also aimed to distinguish differences between the informational needs of parents and the information genetic counselors provide. Online surveys were distributed to members of the National Down Syndrome Congress, National Down Syndrome Society, and National Society of Genetic Counselors. Participants included 993 parents of children with Down syndrome and 389 genetic counselors. Participants rated 100 informational features about Down syndrome as Essential, Important, or Not Too Important for inclusion in the first discussion of the diagnosis. Responses identified 34 essential informational items for the initial discussion of Down syndrome, including clinical features, developmental abilities, a range of prognostications, and informational resources. Healthcare providers should consider incorporating these items in their initial discussion of a diagnosis in both prenatal and postnatal settings. Statistically significant differences between parent and genetic counselor responses illustrate that information is valued differently and that parents appreciate information about the abilities and potential of people with Down syndrome, as opposed to clinical details. Balancing clinical information with other aspects of the condition, as well as a better understanding of the information parents consider most important, may enable healthcare professionals to more effectively satisfy families' informational needs following a new diagnosis of Down syndrome.
