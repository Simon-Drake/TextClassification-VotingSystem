Second trimester levels of maternal serum inhibin A in pregnancies affected by fetal neural tube defects.
Inhibin A is effective as a second trimester maternal serum marker for Down syndrome screening. In the present study, inhibin A levels were measured in second trimester maternal serum samples from 28 pregnancies affected with open neural tube defects; 12 associated with open spina bifida and 16 associated with anencephaly. Each measurement was expressed as a multiple of the median (MoM) for control singleton pregnancies (n=1464) of the same completed week of gestation. Inhibin A levels were not significantly altered in cases of open neural tube defects; the median value was 0.96 MoM in cases of open spina bifida and 1.19 MoM in cases of anencephaly. Therefore, second trimester maternal serum inhibin A levels will not have an impact on prenatal detection of open neural tube defects.
