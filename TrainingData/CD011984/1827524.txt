Trisomic pregnancies have normal human chorionic gonadotropin bioactivity.
Sera from women carrying either chromosomally normal or aneuploid fetuses in the first half of pregnancy were assayed for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) bioactivity in order to determine whether differences might provide the basis for a useful antenatal screen for aneuploidy. A mouse uterine weight assay was used to assess hCG bioactivity in sera from 35 patients undergoing chorionic villus sampling (12 normal pregnancies and 23 trisomic pregnancies) and in sera from 18 patients undergoing elective second-trimester abortion (12 presumed normal pregnancies, 3 trisomic pregnancies, and 3 pregnancies with neural tube defects). The hCG bioactivity to immunoactivity (B:I) ratio of normal pregnancies progressively decreased from 7.7 +/- 1.3 at 4-5 menstrual weeks, to 4.7 +/- 0.4 at 9-12 menstrual weeks, to 3.3 +/- 0.5 at 16-20 menstrual weeks. There were no significant differences in the B:I ratios between normal and aneuploid pregnancies in either the first-trimester (4.7 +/- 0.4 versus 5.2 +/- 0.3) or the second-trimester samples (3.3 +/- 0.5 versus 2.6 +/- 0.3), despite significantly greater hCG concentrations in the trisomic pregnancies. We conclude that while aneuploid pregnancies display dysfunctional regulation of hCG expression, the bioactivity of their hCG is normal and does not appear to form the basis for a useful screen for aneuploidy.
