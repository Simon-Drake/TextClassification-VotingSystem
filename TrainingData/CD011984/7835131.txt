[Quantitative analysis of the cellular DNA and RNA contents of hydatidiform mole and its clinical significance].
The cellular DNA and RNA contents of 152 patients with hydatidiform moles (69 benign and 83 malignant) were analysed by flow cytometry (FCM), and strict follow-up was implemented. The chorionic villi of twelve cases in early pregnancy were used as normal control and another 12 cases of choriocarcinoma as positive control. Retrospective as well as prospective studies were conducted. The results showed that the accuracy rates of diagnosis of DNA aneuploid and RNA were respectively 66.7% and 82.6% in benign moles, 68.7% and 81.9% in invasive moles. Statistically the RNA parameter was significantly more sensitive the DNA parameter (P < 0.05). Analysis with both RNA and DNA parameters in predicting malignancy, the accuracy rate was 94.0%. Our study suggests that both the aneuploidy DNA and RNA contents may be important indicators for forecasting malignant change. The RNA parameter is more sensitive than the DNA parameter, and the use of both parameters is more accurate than either one alone. In addition, the concept of "standard DNA index" is raised.
