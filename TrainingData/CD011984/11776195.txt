[Preliminary analysis of chromosome mosaicism in preimplantation embryos].
OBJECTIVE: Using fluorescence in situ hybridization to analyze chromosome mosaicism in human preimplantation embryos and access the influence of mosaicism on in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. METHODS: Normal fertilized embryos, which were not suitable for embryo transfer and cryopreservation, and male embryos in preimplantation gender diagnosis were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety three nucleuses were found among 38 embryos. The hybridization rate was 96.2%. Twelve embryos (31.6%) were normal. Twenty-eight embryos (73.7%) were diploid embryos, which included normal diploid embryos and embryos with diploid moscaicism. In addition, 19 (50.0%) embryos were considered to be chromosomal mosaics due to diploid mosaicism and abnormal mosaicsm. The frequency of mosaicism increased from 18.2% in < or = 4 cell-stage embryos to 68.4% and 50.0% in 5-8 cell-stage and > or = 9 cell-stage embryos respectively. CONCLUSION: The frequency of Mosaicism increases with successive cleavage divisions. Moscaicism may be one of the important factors affecting the success rates in IVF-ET. Identification of sex by analysis of a single cleavage cell is accurate; however, it would be better to biopsy 2 cells to reduce errors in preimplantation genetic diagnosis of single gene diseases.
