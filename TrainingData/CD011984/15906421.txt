The impact of first-trimester screening on AMA patients' uptake of invasive testing.
OBJECTIVE: Prenatal testing for AMA includes invasive procedures such as CVS and amniocentesis, which have risks. We sought to determine the effects of first-trimester screening (FTS) on referrals for genetic counseling and patients' decisions to pursue invasive testing after FTS was offered in 2002. METHODS: We compared AMA patients presenting for prenatal care who underwent early genetic counseling (<13 weeks' gestation) from 2001 to those from 2003. Charts were reviewed for maternal age, gestational age, past obstetric history, prior CVS or amniocentesis, abnormal ultrasound findings and decision to proceed with invasive testing. The two groups were compared using Student t-test and chi-square tests. RESULTS: In 2001, 552 AMA women enrolled in prenatal care; 68 presented for early genetic counseling. In 2003, 728 AMA women enrolled in prenatal care; 172 presented for early genetic counseling. More counseled women chose genetic testing in 2003 than in 2001 (95% vs 79%, p<0.01). More patients elected an invasive procedure in 2001 compared to 2003 (71% vs 26%, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Availability of FTS results in more AMA women having early prenatal genetic counseling and choosing some form of genetic testing. Such women are less likely to choose invasive tests than those without access to FTS.
