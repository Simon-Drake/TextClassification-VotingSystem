Nasopharyngeal teratoma and mosaic tetrasomy 1q detected at amniocentesis. A case report and review of the literature.
The occurrence of nasopharyngeal teratomas (NPT) is an infrequent event and prenatal detection of such tumors is even rarer. We present a case report and review of the literature (N = 78 cases), in which we describe the cytogenetic, DNA, and pathological findings of a fetus with a mature NPT which was detected prenatally by ultrasound investigation following complaints of severe polyhydramnios by the mother.
