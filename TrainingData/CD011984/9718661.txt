Borderline findings in fetal cardiac sonography.
Borderline or equivocal sonographic findings in the fetal heart are occasionally encountered. Echogenic foci in the ventricles, small pericardial effusions, and mild discrepancy in ventricular size are three such problematic findings. The significance of each of these findings, as currently understood, will be discussed in this article.
