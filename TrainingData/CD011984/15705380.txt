Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening in patients with unexplained recurrent miscarriages.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the aneuploidy rate in embryos of women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriages and to evaluate whether preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening could be a feasible approach to improve the possibility of successful pregnancy in these couples. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary university referral center. PATIENT(S): Women (n = 49) with recurrent idiopathic miscarriages. INTERVENTION(S): In vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ongoing pregnancy rate (PR) and aneuploidy rate. RESULT(S): The aneuploidy rate was, respectively, 43.85% and 66.95% in the younger and older group. The ongoing PR per cycle was 25.71% in the younger and 2.94% in the older patients. CONCLUSION(S): There is no therapeutic evidence to prescribe IVF with or without preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening for this heterogeneous group of patients.
