Chorionic villus sampling.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) has been used a successful and safe first-trimester prenatal diagnostic technique for over 12 years. Developed to avoid the medical and psychological complications of later prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis, CVS rapidly has become a primary tool for the diagnosis of fetal cytogenetic, molecular, and biochemical disorders. In addition, its development has led to an improved understanding of several biological processes, including confined placental mosaicism and uniparental disomy.
