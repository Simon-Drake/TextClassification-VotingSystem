Ten-year experience with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) at the New York University School of Medicine Fertility Center.
We describe our experience of over 300 cycles of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and report clinical pregnancy rates (35%-67%) that support using this technology to screen for genetic disorders and chromosomal abnormalities. In clinical practice for over ten years, PGD offers couples the earliest form of genetic screening and may help improve ongoing pregnancy rates in poor-prognosis patients.
