[The triple test scenario for Styria. With data of the Styria Abnormalities Register].
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to clarify by a cost-effectiveness analysis, if a triple-marker screening for trisomy 21 (triple test) should be established in Austria. METHODS: The published triple-test results of the last years were combined with the data of the Styrian Malformation Register covering the years 1985-1992. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on total costs of prenatal diagnosis, costs per fetus diagnosed as affected, the number of affected fetuses detected, and the number of procedure-related losses. RESULTS: If low costs are given priority, the triple test should be offered to women 35 years of age or older. If a high detection rate is given top priority, the test should be offered to all pregnant women. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the present policy of maternal age screening in Austria should be replaced by maternal serum screening.
