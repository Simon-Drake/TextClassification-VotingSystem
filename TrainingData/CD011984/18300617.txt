[Can we improve the content and quality of information delivered prior to amniocentesis?].
INTRODUCTION: Amniocentesis is a procedure often used for pregnant women, as an important tool to identify chromosomal abnormalities, trisomy 21 being the main one. Amniocentesis may involve certain possible complications, the most prevalent is miscarriage. In order to make an informed decision, a woman must understand some statistical information regarding the risks and benefits of management options. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work was to examine women's understanding of risks and benefits before amniocentesis and the effect of an educational intervention on this understanding. METHODS: Women applying for amniocentesis at Hadassah Ein-Kerem clinics were handed a questionnaire. The questionnaire examined several aspects of knowledge relevant to an informed decision about the amniocentesis. An intervention was designed to improve women's understanding before amniocentesis: an information handout was sent home to 48 women who had signed up for amniocentesis. The level of knowledge was compared between women who did and did not receive the information handout. RESULTS: There was no difference in the level of general understanding between the two groups. When the level of understanding was broken down to its specific components, it became apparent that the only improvement achieved was concerning the risk of miscarriage from the amniocentesis. CONCLUSIONS: Information delivered before amniocentesis is challenging and further research is needed in order to develop educational material that would improve women's understanding of risks and benefits of the procedure.
