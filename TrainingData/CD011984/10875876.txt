Histological and genetic analysis and risk assessment for chromosomal aberration after ICSI for patients presenting with CBAVD.
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has opened a new field in the treatment of male infertility, leading to a debate concerning its genetic safety. In this study we present an analysis of 11 patients presenting congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). In all 11 cases, genetic counselling, histological analysis of testicular biopsies, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation screenings of both partners and spermatozoa three-colour fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were performed. A total of 31 CFTR mutations were screened and mutations were found in eight out of 11 cases, with DeltaF508 being the most common mutation found. Histological analyses showed that seven out of 11 patients had normal tubule/membrane/interstitium (TMI) and Johnsen scores, while the remaining four patients had mild impairment of testicular parenchyma. The average aneuploidy rate was 6.8 +/- 3.9% compared with two control subjects with 4.4 and 5.4% aneuploidy rates respectively, using FISH analysis. After ICSI, the fertilization and pregnancy rates were 66.2 and 22.7% respectively. Thus, in our case of CBAVD, the risk of chromosomal aberration following ICSI, in the absence of a CFTR mutation in the male patient and/or in his partner, was not higher than in normal fertile men. Furthermore, the pregnancy success rate following ICSI of these CBAVD patients was comparable to the general ICSI population, even when histological analysis showed limited spermatogenesis.
