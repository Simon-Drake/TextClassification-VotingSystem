Maternal serum screening for Down syndrome: a survey of pregnant women's views.
OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to assess women's self-reported awareness of Down syndrome before they became pregnant and after they were supposedly informed about screening. We investigated their understanding of the purpose of screening and what a high statistical risk for Down syndrome means, and if there was a high statistical risk whether they would undergo amniocentesis. METHODS: Pregnant women (n=274) ranging from 17 to 43 years of age, with different educational backgrounds, were surveyed by means of a questionnaire which was given to them immediately before blood samples were taken. RESULTS: Women without a college education were significantly less likely then those with a college education to be aware of Down syndrome prior to pregnancy. Many of them reported being unaware of it even after they had been counseled and tested. Women with a lower level of education were also significantly less likely to have a clear understanding of purpose of screening. Fewer than 0.7% of women who were tested said they were not prepared to undergo amniocentesis, and 47.1% said they would consider amniocentesis only after receiving the screening test result. CONCLUSION: Procedures for education women prior to maternal screening must be provided.
