[Methylation profiling of the cell cycle regulating genes in placenta of human embryos with chromosomal mosaicism].
To date the investigation of epigenetic mechanisms of cell cycle regulation, ensuring genomic stability maintaining and accurate transfer of hereditary information to daughter cells, is of a considerable interest. Development of the up-to-date molecular technologies allows determining methylation pattern of the whole genome at a single round of analysis. In this work for the first time the epigenetic status of placental tissues of human embryos with mosaic karyotype was studied using the genome-wide Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Array (Illumina, USA). The groups of genes, related to the cell cycle and its regulation and containing differentially methylated CpG-sites in their promoter regions, are determined. The methylation level of oncogenes (ARHGEF1, RGF5), tumor-suppressors (APC2, BRACA2, DCC, GRLF1, RB1, TP73, TSPYL2, VHL) as well as genes, participating in chromosome segregation regulation (CNTROB, GMNN, PROCR, TACC1), was changed most frequently.
