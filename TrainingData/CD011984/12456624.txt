Possible interchromosomal effect in embryos generated by gametes from translocation carriers.
BACKGROUND: The incidence of abnormal pregnancies in carriers of balanced translocations depends strictly on the chromosomes involved in the translocations. The aim of this study was to verify whether conventional aneuploidy screening could be advantageously combined with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for translocations. METHODS: Twenty-eight carriers of Robertsonian and reciprocal translocations underwent 43 PGD cycles; specific probes were used to screen the translocation in 172 embryos generated by 35 cycles; most of these embryos were also screened for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, 22 (n = 166), XY (n = 107), 1 (n = 17) and 15 (n = 88). For the remaining eight cycles (carriers of reciprocal translocations) only the chromosomes involved in common aneuploidy screening were investigated on the 40 embryos generated in vitro. RESULTS: In Robertsonian translocations, the proportion of embryos with abnormalities due to the translocation was 21%, common aneuploidies contributed 31% of total abnormalities, whereas the remaining 36% of embryos had abnormalities due to both types of chromosome. For reciprocal translocations, the chromosomes involved in the translocation were responsible for 65% of total abnormalities; only 6% of the embryos were abnormal for common aneuploidies and 16% carried abnormalities due to both the chromosomes involved in the translocation and those not related to the translocation. CONCLUSIONS: An interchromosomal effect seems to play a role in the case of Robertsonian translocations, where the relevant contribution of aneuploidy exposes the couple to an additional risk of abnormal pregnancy.
