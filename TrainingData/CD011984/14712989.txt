BACKGROUND: The present study assessed the screening tests for Down syndrome available to women within Australian hospitals. METHODS: Postal questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 282 (57%) hospitals responded with over two-thirds offering some form of screening test which varied by geographical region and level of institution. First trimester maternal serum screening was offered by 11% of hospitals. Nuchal translucency screening was offered by 52% of hospitals with higher use in Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales than in the other regions. Second trimester maternal serum screening was offered by 75% of hospitals with higher rates in Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and the lowest rate in Queensland. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of women are offered screening but with wide variation in the tests used.
