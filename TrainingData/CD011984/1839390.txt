KAP study on mothers of children with Down syndrome.
We evaluated 50 mothers of children with Down syndrome attending Genetic Clinic of the Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children, Madras, with special reference to their knowledge, belief and attitudes in the care of these children. After evaluation, they were educated individually and in groups with demonstration, picture cards and pamphlets, on the causation, expected health problems, developmental potential of Down syndrome and the ways and means to help the child to attain the maximum developmental potential. They were taught on preventive aspects of Down syndrome as well. Re-evaluation was done after three months, and considerable improvement was noted in the mother's knowledge, and attitude towards bringing up such a child. The mothers also showed an improvement in the skills in providing developmental enrichment to these children. Thus this study has formulated a programme in the management of such children, which can be practised on any population, anywhere, especially, in rural areas, and by less affluent folk, with poor educational background.
