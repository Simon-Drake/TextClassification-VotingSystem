Prospective study of the quality of survival of infants with critical fetal reserve detected by antenatal cardiotocography.
From 1981 to 1986 antenatal cardiotocographic monitoring was performed on 9,992 high-risk pregnancies selected from a total obstetrical population of 31,518 patients (31.7%). A critical fetal reserve pattern was detected in 89 patients (0.9%) whose pregnancies resulted in 68 surviving infants, 19 perinatal deaths and 2 sudden infant deaths. Since 47.4% of the infants who died in the perinatal period did so because of a related congenital malformation, such a defect should be excluded in the fetus with critical fetal reserve, by ultrasonography, before delivery (there is usually insufficient time for fetal karyotyping). Sixty-three (92.6%) of the surviving children were assessed at our Growth and Developmental Clinic and disabilities were detected in 16 (25.4%); however, the disability was major in only 5, including 2 children with Down syndrome. The quality of survival of infants born from pregnancies complicated by critical fetal reserve was satisfactory as 60 of 63 children (95.2%) had neither a major disability related to intrauterine hypoxia identified by the cardiotocographic pattern, or had one likely to significantly interfere with their quality of life. Our results suggest that pregnancies can be continued until the cardiotocographic pattern becomes critical in order to gain fetal maturity, without compromise to the fetal brain.
