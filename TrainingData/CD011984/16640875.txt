[Two different genetic analyses of spontaneously aborted specimen].
OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to be used for analysis of spontaneously aborted tissue. METHODS: Thirty eight patients with spontaneous abortion were recruited in this study. The gestational age of these cases was between 49 and 91 days based on ultrasound scan. All specimens of chorionic villi were collected via the cervix. Conventional cytogenetic karyotyping and CGH analysis were carried out to detect chromosomal unbalanced abnormalities in the tissue specimens. RESULTS: CGH analysis was successful in all 38 cases, but cytogenetic karyotying failed in 7 cases. Identical results in both CGH and conventional cytogenetic analysis were obtained in 90% (28/31) cases. Discrepancy in result between cytogenetic and CGH results was shown in 3 cases. One case presented 46XY karyotype by karyotyping, whereas showed chromosome 3q(22)-q(24) aberration in CGH analysis. Two cases showed triploidy by karyotyping, but normal in CGH analysis. In the 7 cases that failed in cytogenetic analysis there were 3 cases showing aneuploidy in CGH analysis. CONCLUSION: CGH analysis is feasible to be used for identification of chromosomal unbalanced abnormalities related to spontaneous abortion.
