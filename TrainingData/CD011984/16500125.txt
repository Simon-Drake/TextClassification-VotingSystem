Congenital corectopia (eccentric pupils): a marker for chromosomal and central nervous system abnormality.
We present a case series of five children with congenital corectopia without any associated ocular cause: three had chromosomal abnormalities; one a probable prenatal diplegia, and one bilateral perisylvian dysplasia with vermian and midbrain hypoplasia. Bilateral congenital corectopia is an ophthalmic sign that merits chromosomal analysis and neuro-developmental assessment.
