Molecular analysis of 53 fragile X families with the probe StB12.3.
Fifty-three pedigrees with the fragile X syndrome have been studied for amplification of the CGG repeat sequence adjacent to the CpG island in the FMR1 gene. Probe StB12.3 allowed direct detection of affected males, carrier females, normal transmitting males, as well as prenatal diagnosis. Comparison of our molecular data with our previous linkage data from 38 families indicates the effectiveness of direct DNA analysis. A total of 325 individuals were studied and no new mutation was found. All daughters of males with a premutation had a premutation. When the mother had a full mutation no children had a premutation. In premutated mothers, the size of the premutation seems to be a determining factor for the transition to the full mutation. All affected males had a full mutation or mosaicism and only 42% of the females with a full mutation were mentally impaired. Analysis of large families over 3 generations illustrated clearly the Sherman paradox. Furthermore, the analysis of these families is in reasonable agreement with the multiallelic model of Morton and Macpherson [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:4215-4217, 1992]. Mosaic cases in the offspring of the mothers with a full mutation suggest a maternal germinal mosaicism. Then an abnormal methylation and a somatic heterogeneity established in very early steps of embryogenesis could explain these cases.
