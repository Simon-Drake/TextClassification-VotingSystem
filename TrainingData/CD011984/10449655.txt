Tetrasomy 9p due to an intrachromosomal triplication of 9p13-p22.
To date, approximately 30 patients have been described with a tetrasomy 9p, all being caused by the presence of an isochromosome 9p. We now report on a 3-year-old boy with a de novo intrachromosomal triplication of 9p13-p22, resulting in partial tetrasomy 9p. We compared his phenotype with cases of tetrasomy 9p caused by the presence of an extra isochromosome 9p. He has facial anomalies similar to those of cases of tetrasomy 9p, central nervous system abnormalities, and severe psychomotor retardation but no other major congenital anomalies. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with region-specific probes showed that the middle repeat of the triplicated part is inverted. Microsatellite analysis demonstrated an involvement of both paternal chromosome 9 homologues in the triplication. This is compatible with either unequal crossing over of three of the four chromatids in paternal meiosis I or with a double crossing over in meiosis I and II (or an early mitotic division).
