Amniotic fluid levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and its alpha and beta subunits in second-trimester chromosomally abnormal pregnancies.
Amniotic fluid from 135 pregnancies was assayed for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and its free alpha (ahCG) and free beta (bhCG) subunits. Forty-six chromosomally abnormal pregnancies between 14 and 20 weeks' gestation were matched with 89 chromosomally normal samples. Compared with controls, trisomy 21 pregnancies exhibited significantly elevated levels of all three peptides, whereas trisomy 18 gestations gave rise only to significant elevation of ahCG. Female fetuses in both the trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 pregnancies provided significantly elevated levels of hCG and bhCG compared to their male counterparts. On converting the values to multiples of the median, it was determined that 6 of 7 trisomy 18 samples had abnormally elevated alpha/beta ratios, as did 6 of 21 Down's syndrome pregnancies. Further, 11 of 21 trisomy 21 gestations had abnormal amniotic fluid hCG levels. Using only ahCG, bhCG and their ratio, a 61 per cent sensitivity was found for these trisomies, with a 96 per cent specificity.
