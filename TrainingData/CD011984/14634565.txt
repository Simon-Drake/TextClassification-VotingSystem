Effects of maternal age and education on the pattern of prenatal testing: implications for the use of antenatal screening as a solution to the growing number of amniocenteses.
OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess age-specific effects of maternal education on patterns of prenatal testing. STUDY DESIGN: We used data from a sample of all births in France in 1998. Statistical analysis included logistic regression and likelihood ratio tests. RESULTS: The rate of amniocentesis of women without serum screening was 7.3% for those with 12 years or less, and 16.7% for those with more than 12 years of education. Women with lower levels of education were about 50% more likely to have an amniocentesis if they had serum screening (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8). In contrast, women with higher levels of education were less likely to have an amniocentesis with screening (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.8); the education effect persisted across maternal age groups. CONCLUSION: Many women eligible for reimbursed serum screening, in particular those with higher levels of education, obtain amniocentesis without serum screening. This might limit the use of antenatal screening as a solution to the growing number of amniocenteses.
