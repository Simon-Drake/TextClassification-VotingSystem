Simultaneous detection of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization in blastomeres obtained from preimplantation embryos.
PURPOSE: Simultaneous fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used in a preimplantation genetic diagnosis program to determine which embryos were normal for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21. METHODS: Single blastomeres were disrupted and attached to glass slides using acetic acid and ethanol. Using a ratio mixture of chromosome enumeration DNA probes in combination with locus-specific identifier DNA probes, FISH was performed for the identification of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21. RESULTS: Fourteen couples enrolled in IVF produced 134 embryos for biopsy. Blastomeres subjected to five-color FISH revealed that 22% of embryos were normal for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21. In addition, 52% were abnormal and no results could be detected for 25%. Twelve couples underwent embryo transfer, two couples did not receive embryos due to lack of any normal embryos, and three couples became pregnant. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous detection of five-color FISH is a feasible method to detect aneuploidy in preimplantation embryos from women of advanced maternal age.
