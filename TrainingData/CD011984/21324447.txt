Lipocalin-1: a potential marker for noninvasive aneuploidy screening.
This study has identified the first protein, lipocalin-1, in the secretome of human blastocysts that is associated with chromosome aneuploidy. The development of a noninvasive technique to determine an embryo's developmental competence, including chromosomal constitution, by analysis of spent IVF culture medium will be a powerful tool for embryo selection in assisted reproductive technologies.
