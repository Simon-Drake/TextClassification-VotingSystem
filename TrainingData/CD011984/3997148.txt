Maternal age-specific rates of numerical chromosome abnormalities with special reference to trisomy.
The effect of maternal age on the incidence of chromosomally normal spontaneous abortion and different categories of chromosome abnormality among all clinically recognized human pregnancies was evaluated. The results provide no evidence for a significant association of age with sex chromosome monosomy or polyploidy, but clearly demonstrate an effect of age on the frequency of trisomy and chromosomally normal spontaneous abortions. Estimated maternal age-specific rates of trisomy among all recognized pregnancies were calculated and suggest that a majority of oocytes of women aged 40 years and older may be aneuploid.
