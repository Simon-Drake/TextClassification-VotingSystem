Spontaneous abortion and confined chromosomal mosaicism.
Confined placental chorionic mosaicism is reported in 2% of viable pregnancies cytogenetically analyzed on chorionic villi samplings (CVS) at 9-12 weeks of gestation. In follow-up studies this mosaicism has been shown to be associated with increased frequency of second and third trimester pregnancy loss or intrauterine fetal growth retardation. We have studied 54 spontaneous abortions (SA) for the detection of confined placental mosaicism and found 11 of them to be mosaic. All mosaic cases were identified among first trimester spontaneous abortions, and the mosaicism was confined to specific placental or embryonic/fetal cell lineages. These results indicate that the previously reported mosaicism in SA represents both confined and generalized types of mosaicism and that its accepted frequency of 5%-10% in SA will likely be higher. Over the whole gestational period, the confined placental mosaicism is more common than the reported rate of 1%-2% seen in viable pregnancies at CVS, and a higher proportion of pregnancy complications than previously suspected may be associated with confined placental mosaicism.
