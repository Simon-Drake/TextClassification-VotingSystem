Prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes by combinations of first and second trimester biochemistry markers used in the routine prenatal screening of Down syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between four defined adverse pregnancy outcomes and levels of first and second trimester maternal serum markers focusing in particular on how well combinations of markers predict these adverse outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of associations between first and second trimester serum markers and adverse pregnancy outcomes among 141 698 women who underwent prenatal screening for Down syndrome in Ontario, Canada. Detection rates (DR), false positive rates (FPR), and odds ratios were estimated using both single and combinations of markers for the adverse outcomes defined. RESULTS: Women with decreased second trimester unconjugated oestriol (uE3), deceased first trimester maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), increased second trimester serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP), or increased second trimester total human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) were at greater risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes. At a 5% FPR, combinations of these markers predicted at best 33.3% of fetal loss and 31.5% of preterm births (PTB) before 32 weeks of gestation. CONCLUSION: There are significant associations between the levels of first and second trimester serum markers and adverse obstetric outcomes. However, even combinations of these markers can only predict adverse obstetric outcomes with modest accuracy.
