Detection of mosaicism for primary trisomies in prenatal samples by QF-PCR and karyotype analysis.
OBJECTIVES: QF-PCR can be used to rapidly diagnose primary trisomy in prenatal samples. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of primary trisomy mosaicism for chromosomes 13, 18 or 21 in a cohort of prenatal samples, and to compare and contrast the detection of this mosaicism using both QF-PCR and karyotype analysis. METHODS: Data was collated from all prenatal samples displaying mosaicism for a primary trisomy between June 2000 and March 2004. Levels of mosaicism were estimated and samples were categorised according to the cell population in which the mosaicism was detected. RESULTS: In a total of 8983 samples, 18 samples (0.20%) displaying mosaicism were detected, including trisomy 13 (three samples), trisomy 18 (seven samples), trisomy 21 (seven samples) and mosaic triploidy (one sample). This included 7 amniotic fluid and 11 chorionic villus samples. Mosaicism was detected by QF-PCR in 12 samples and by karyotype analysis in 8 samples. CONCLUSIONS: QF-PCR can detect mosaicism when the abnormal cell line contributes at least 15% of the whole sample. Use of both karyotype and QF-PCR analysis leads to the detection of more cases of mosaicism than either test alone.
