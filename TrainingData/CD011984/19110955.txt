[Ductus venosus Arantii in the fetal venosus circulation: anatomical and clinical aspects].
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to summarize the published data on the anatomical structure of the ductus venosus, the mechanism of regulation of the ductus venosus shunting and its role in the fetal survival and the possible use of the measurement of the ductus venosus shunting in the clinical practice. DESIGN: Review. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Medical Faculty Charles University Hradec Kralove. METHODS: We summarized published data on the ductus venosus shunting in the fetal venosus circulation with the regulatory mechanisms, doppler ultrasound diagnostic methods and the medical importance. CONCLUSION: The present review summarizes the results of clinical and experimental research on the ductus venosus in the fetal circulation.
