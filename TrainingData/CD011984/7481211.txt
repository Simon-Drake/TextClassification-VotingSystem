Methods for maternal age-standardization of the incidence of congenital abnormalities.
In order to compare the birth incidences of particular congenital abnormalities in different populations, it is often necessary to allow for the effects of maternal age. Three age-adjusted indices are defined, based on analogous indices from the literature on mortality studies, namely, the Standardized Mortality Ratio, the Comparative Mortality Figure and Kerridge's Inverse Method. In most practical situations the differences between them are likely to be trival. However, the first index is maximally efficient under multiplicative risk models and is easily adjusted for incomplete data. The second is the only one to provide valid comparisons under additive, as well as multiplicative, models. The third has the advantage that it does not require a knowledge of the maternal age distribution of all births in the population. The use of the three indices is illustrated with published data on Down's syndrome.
