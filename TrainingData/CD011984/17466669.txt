The risk of a major trisomy in fetuses with pyelectasis: the impact of an abnormal maternal serum screen or additional sonographic markers.
OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the contribution of either an abnormal second-trimester maternal serum screen or the presence of additional sonographic markers of aneuploidy to the risk of a major trisomy (13, 18, and 21) in fetuses with pyelectasis. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of a large amniocentesis database was performed. Specimens obtained after the sonographic detection of fetal pyelectasis were eligible for analysis. Age-matched women who underwent amniocentesis solely for maternal anxiety or advanced maternal age served as controls. RESULTS: 760,495 amniocentesis specimens were analyzed. Fetal pyelectasis was detected in 671 cases. Pyelectasis, with either a single or multiple additional sonographic markers, was associated with an 8-fold and 62-fold increase in the prevalence of major trisomies (odds ratio = 7.7, 95% CI = 1.2-32.6, P = 0.02) and (odds ratio = 61.9, 95% CI = 13.2-144.6, P < .001), respectively. Pyelectasis with an abnormal maternal serum screen, with or without additional sonographic markers, was associated with a 32-fold and a 205-fold increase in major trisomies (odds ratio = 32.2, 95% CI = 5.3-94.8, P < .001) and (odds ratio = 205.8, 95% CI = 37.9-427.6, P < .001), respectively. CONCLUSION: In fetuses with pyelectasis, the presence of additional sonographic markers or an abnormal maternal serum screen significantly increases the risk of trisomy 13, 18, and 21.
