The reference range and within-person variability of thyroid stimulating hormone during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE: To further explore first and second trimester reference ranges for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and examine within-person variability of TSH and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody. SETTING: Women coming for routine prenatal care in early pregnancy agreed to participate in a trial of integrated serum screening for Down's syndrome. Two serum samples were obtained from each woman, one each in the first and second trimesters. These samples were also available for TSH and TPO measurements in the present study. METHODS: TSH and TPO antibody measurements were performed in 1126 women with ultrasound-dated pregnancies who provided serum samples in both trimesters. TSH reference ranges were established for the entire cohort and for the antibody-negative subgroup. Within-person variability of TSH measurements between trimesters was examined. RESULTS: Median TSH values are lower in the first trimester than in the second (1.00 versus 1.29 mIU/l), but 98th centile values are higher (5.20 versus 4.18 mIU/l). High correlation exists between individual women's first and second trimester TSH measurements (r=0.75, r2=0.56, p<0.001). Among 23 women with TSH values above the 98th centile in the second trimester, 17 (74%) were over the 95th centile in the first trimester. TPO antibody measurements are also highly correlated between trimesters (r=0.97, r)=0.94). CONCLUSION: Proper interpretation of TSH measurements during pregnancy requires that laboratories establish and monitor appropriate reference ranges. TSH levels show high within-person consistency between trimesters.
