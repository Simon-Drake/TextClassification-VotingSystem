[Women's experience of chorionic villi biopsy and its significance for the course of pregnancy. A qualitative study].
Twenty-nine pregnant women and their families were questioned about how they experienced chorion villus biopsy in order to illustrate the significance of the test for the pregnancy. Semistructured interviews were carried out immediately after the test, one week later when the result was available and at ultrasonic scanning at the 18th-20th weeks of pregnancy, and these results form the basis for this study. One woman had a foetus with Down's syndrome. The remaining foetuses had normal chromosomes. The main interpretation of early foetal diagnosis and of a living foetus was positive. For the pregnant woman and her family, the main advantages were that the time of waiting for the result was reduced (as compared to the waiting time following amniocentesis) the psychological relief that the investigation can be performed early in pregnancy and that a possible termination could take place under full anaesthesia.
