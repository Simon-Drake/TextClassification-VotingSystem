Down's syndrome and the general practitioner.
People with Down's syndrome form a heterogeneous group sharing a single constant feature--an extra chromosome. This paper reviews the many clinical problems associated with Down's syndrome and emphasizes the prevention of secondary handicapping conditions. Current policies on antenatal screening for Down's syndrome are discussed. The review draws attention to the need for general practitioners to see themselves as part of a network of community services providing support to people with Down's syndrome and their families.
