Prenatal diagnosis of mosaic ring chromosome 13 with anencephaly.
We report on the prenatal diagnosis, genetic analysis and clinical manifestations of a second-trimester fetus with mosaic ring chromosome 13 and anencephaly. A 35-year-old, gravida 3, para 2 woman was referred for genetic counselling at 23 weeks' gestation because of an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level of 2.386 multiples of the median. Prenatal ultrasonography showed intrauterine growth retardation and anencephaly. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of de novo mos 46,xx,r(13)(p11q32)/45,xx,-r(13) [corrected] (77%/23%). Molecular genetic analysis by quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with small tandem repeat markers specific for chromosome 13 rapidly confirmed the maternal origin of the aberrant chromosome and determined the breakpoint at 13q32 between D13S225 (present) and D13S147 (absent). Our present finding indicates that anencephaly can be due to mosaic r(13) with a terminal deletion of 13q32-13q34 and an additional secondary rearrangement of loss of r(13). We propose that cytogenetic analysis is beneficial and warranted in pregnancies with fetal neural tube defects.
