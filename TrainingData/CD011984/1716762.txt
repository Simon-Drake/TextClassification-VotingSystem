Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase quantification from fetal erythrocytes--an efficient confirmatory test for Down's syndrome after maternal serum screening and sonographic investigations.
An enzyme immunoassay especially designed for the quantification of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) in erythrocytes has been applied to measure the SOD of outcomes with high risk for Down's syndrome. From 148 fetuses SOD was quantified from erythrocytes of umbilical vein blood and related to the number of cells, the content of haemoglobin (Hb), and to the haematocrit (Hc). Comparative studies between the SOD content of erythrocytes from the fetuses and their mothers resulted in similar SOD levels (14.09 +/- 1.20 for fetal and 14.48 +/- 1.63 for maternal cells) with a 1.84-fold smaller variance for fetal cells. The best differentiation between normal fetuses and fetuses with Down's syndrome resulted from the SOD/cell ratio followed by the SOD/Hb ratio. Fixing a cut-off value from the probability density functions that the method results in a specificity of 99.99 per cent, the sensitivity to detect cases of Down's syndrome was 99.71 per cent for the SOD/cell ratio, 70.92 per cent for the SOD/Hb ratio, and 60.21 per cent for the SOD/He ratio. Nine cases with Down's syndrome were correctly diagnosed by the SOD/cell ratio determination. Eight of these were confirmed as free trisomy 21 by karyotype analysis and one was found to be a triploidy. The latter was not detected by the SOD/Hb and SOD/Hc ratios because of the one-third higher content of haemoglobin and the larger volume of the erythrocytes which resulted in ratios within the normal range.
