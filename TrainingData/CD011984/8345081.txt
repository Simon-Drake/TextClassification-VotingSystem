Assessment of polyploidy in human morulae and blastocysts using co-culture and fluorescent in-situ hybridization.
Fluorescence in-situ hybridization with DNA probes for X, Y and no. 18 chromosomes was used to analyse human morulae (n = 13) and blastocysts (n = 41), obtained after co-culture on Vero cells. On the basis of the number of hybridization signals, the proportion of embryos with more than five polyploid cells was 30.8% for morulae and 29.3% for blastocysts. These values are similar to those for mixoploidy (mosaicism of diploid and polyploid cells) observed in blastocysts of animal species. The results were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, which showed a wide variation in the size of blastocyst nuclei, and by classical cytogenetic analysis. Mixoploidy seems to be a normal feature in preimplantation embryos and to occur very early in human embryo development. This lays open to doubt the preimplantation diagnosis of genetic errors at these stages, since results obtained from single cell analysis may not be representative of the whole embryo.
