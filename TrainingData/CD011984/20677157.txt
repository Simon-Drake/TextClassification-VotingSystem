[Application of fluorescence in situ hybridization to prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidy in 110 uncultured amniotic fluid samples].
OBJECTIVE: To optimize the prenatal diagnosis platform by using domestically made fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) kit and to explore the clinical application of FISH to rapid prenatal diagnosis of a wide range of chromosomal abnormalities. METHODS: Amniotic fluid samples from 110 pregnant women were studied with the rapid prenatal diagnosis method of FISH and the conventional cell culture method of karyotyping, the results from both methods were compared. RESULTS: Four cases of trisomy 21, 1 case of trisomy 18, 58 cases of 46, XX, and 47 cases of 46, XY were detected by FISH in the 110 amniotic fluid samples. It is concordant with the results from conventional karyotype analysis. The concordance rate is 100%. CONCLUSION: Domestically made FISH kit can be used to rapidly and accurately detect the most common chromosome aneuploidies by using less sample volume while the price is relatively low. FISH can be a reliable and rapid prenatal diagnostic tool as an adjunct to classical cytogenetic study. It can be used for rapid and accurate prenatal diagnosis of women with high risk of maternal serum screening.
