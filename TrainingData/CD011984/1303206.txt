Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization for the simultaneous detection of probe sets for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y in uncultured amniotic fluid cells.
The most frequent aneuploidies in newborns involve the autosomes 13, 18 and 21 as well as both sex chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization readily allows the detection of numerical chromosomal aberrations throughout all stages of the cell cycle. Using a multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization approach based on combinatorial probe labeling and digital imaging microscopy we demonstrate the simultaneous visualization of probe sets specific for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. This approach enables one to evaluate aberrations of multiple chromosomes in a single hybridization experiment using metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei from a variety of cell types, including lymphocytes and amniocytes.
