First confirmed case with paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 16.
The existence of paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 16 [upd(16)pat] has previously been suspected but has not been proven. We report prenatal detection and follow-up of isodisomic upd(16)pat in a child with minimal defects but otherwise normal development. Our results indicate that isodisomic upd(16)pat is associated with a normal outcome if no recessive mutation is reduced to homozygosity.
