Mosaic tetrasomy 12p.
Mosaic tetrasomy 12p is a dysmorphic syndrome which has been described under the name of Pallister mosaic syndrome and Teschler-Nicola/Killian syndrome and has sometimes been incorrectly interpreted as tetrasomy 21. Here we report the first case to be diagnosed prenatally and confirmed by enzyme assays, and we summarize the clinical and biological characteristics of all the cases reported so far under various names.
