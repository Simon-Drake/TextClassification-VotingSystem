[Compliance endogenous and exogenous estriol in clinical practice].
The aim of this study is presenting contemporary datas of the chemical structure, clinical meanings and the role of the weakest estrogen-estriol. Measurement of the level of estriol can serve as a marker of fetus's well-being, can detect some congenital diseases like: Down syndrome, trisomy 18. Inappropriate values of E3 are often associated with high risk pregnancies like: pregnancy-induced hypertension, miscarriage, preterm delivery or intrahepatic cholestasis. It seems, that estriol can be used in hormonal replacement therapy. Some experiments on animals indicates, that estriol administration can be effective in the treatment some autoimmunological diseases.
