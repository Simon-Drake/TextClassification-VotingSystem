Maternal serum screening for fetal Down syndrome in IVF pregnancies.
To assess the influence of in vitro fertilization (IVF) on maternal serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), the maternal serum hCG and AFP values were studied in 67 IVF pregnancies and compared with the results of a control group of 4732 spontaneously conceiving patients. Maternal serum hCG was significantly higher and AFP significantly lower in the IVF group. Possible explanations and implications for prenatal diagnosis in IVF pregnancies are discussed.
