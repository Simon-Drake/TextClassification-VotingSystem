Central nervous system anomalies.
Fetal central nervous system abnormalities encompass a variety of lesions. Most of the anomalies are seen in association with an increased incidence of fetal aneuploidy and an increase in other anomalies both within and outside of the central nervous system. These associated findings and the underlying lesion all have a role in the eventual prognosis for the ongoing pregnancy. The antenatal diagnosis of a central nervous system abnormality should prompt a careful search for other defects, and consideration should be given for genetic evaluation and testing.
