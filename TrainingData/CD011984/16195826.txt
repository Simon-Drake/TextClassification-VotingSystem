Comparison of growth rates of fresh and frozen-thawed embryos according to chromosomal status.
PURPOSE: To report a comparison of growth rates between fresh and frozen-thawed embryos on day 3 and 4 according to chromosomal status during PGD. METHODS: Embryos were biopsied on day 3, fluorescent in situ hybridization performed for aneuploidy detection and growth rates monitored. RESULTS: Based on 241 egg pick up-PGD and 133 frozen embryo transfer-PGD cycles. The development rate of embryos despite their chromosomal status was similar on day 3, however, overall, fresh embryos showed a significantly improved development (> or =6 cell stage; 85.7%) compared to frozen embryos (77.0%; p < 0.003). On day 4 fresh embryos showed accelerated development and further developmental improvements were associated with chromosomal normality (56.1% normal vs. 42.2% aneuploid; p < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Cryopreservation slows embryo development regardless of the chromosomal status. However, chromosomal status did not influence the chance of embryo implantation which was the same for fresh and thawed embryos.
