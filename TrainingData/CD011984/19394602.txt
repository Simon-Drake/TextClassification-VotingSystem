How to predict implantation? No correlation between embryonic aneuploidy and soluble human leukocyte antigen G-concentrations.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if soluble human leukocyte antigen-G (sHLA-G) concentrations in spent culture media may assist in identifying the normal embryo for implantation. DESIGN: Prospective blinded comparative study. SETTING: Reproductive genetic and reproductive medicine centers. PATIENT(S): One hundred and sixteen embryos obtained from eight patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). INTERVENTION(S): Culture media obtained 2 days after fertilization were analyzed for sHLA-G concentrations using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. A sHLA-G concentration of >or=1.9 mIU/mL was considered a positive predictor for successful implantation. Polar bodies and blastomeres from day-3 embryos were tested by PGD for 5 to 11 chromosomes: 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The results of the sHLA-G concentrations were compared with the results of the PGD analyses. RESULT(S): We found an sHLA-G concentration >or=1.9 mIU/mL in 48% (56 out of 116) and normal PGD results in 52% (57 out of 116) of embryos. Of the embryos with normal PGD results, 46% (26 out of 57) had sHLA-G concentrations >or=1.9 mIU/mL. Among the embryos with sHLA-G >or=1.9 mIU/mL, 46% (26 out of 56) had normal PGD results, and 21% of embryos displayed both normal PGD results and sHLA-G >or=1.9 mIU/mL. CONCLUSION(S): No correlation between concentrations of sHLA-G in embryo culture media and PGD results of an embryo's aneuploidy were observed.
