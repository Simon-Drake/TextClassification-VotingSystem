Maternal serum screening in the Sioux Lookout Zone. Complicated test for an unspecified need.
We investigated whether the incidence of fetal abnormalities among patients in Sioux Lookout Zone differs from incidence elsewhere in Canada, whether First Nations people would agree to screening, how information could be disseminated, and what practical considerations would affect implementation. Incidence appears to be similar to elsewhere, but First Nations people's cultural and spiritual beliefs and the difficulty of taking action once results are confirmed make current screening programs inappropriate.
