[Anatomy of arteries of the upper extremity in various chromosomal and gene mutations].
Changeability of major + arteries and their main branches has been studied in 159 preparations of the upper extremities of fetuses, newborns and children of suckling age with trisomies of 13, 18, and 21 chromosomes, anencephaly in newborns, died at asphyxia or birth injury without any visible developmental defects. Manifestation of anatomical changeability in the human being is under an essential influence of peculiarities of genotypes. In morphogenesis of the upper extremity arteries genes of 13, 18 and 21 chromosomes participate. Trisomies of 13, 18 chromosomes cause more manifested and specific changes in morphogenesis of some structures, and trisomy 21 and mutant genes, producing anencephaly , only increase variability of their structure.
