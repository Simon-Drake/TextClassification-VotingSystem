Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of aneuploidy: were we looking at the wrong chromosomes?
PURPOSE: Our purpose was to study aneuploidy frequencies of chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 22 in cleavage-stage embryos. These frequencies were compared to spontaneous abortion data to determine differences in survival rate of their aneuploidies. METHODS: One hundred ninety-four embryos were analyzed with multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization. Embryos were divided into three maternal age groups: 20 to 34.9 years, (2) 35 to 39.9 years, and (3) 40 years and older. Embryos were also divided into two developmental and morphological groups; arrested and nonarrested embryos. RESULTS: The rate of aneuploidy was 14.51%, 14.10%, and 31.48% for age groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P < 0.005). The chromosomes most frequently involved in aneuploidy events were 22, 15, 1, and 17. CONCLUSIONS: The chromosomes most involved in spontaneous abortions are not necessarily the ones causing a decrease in implantation rates with maternal age. Other aneuploidies, such as for chromosomes 1 and 17, may seldom implant or die shortly after implantation.
