[AFP, uE3, beta-hCG levels applied for prenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between fetal trisomy 21 and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated oestriol (uE3) and beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels in maternal serum, amniotic fluid and fetal serum. METHOD: AFP, uE3 and beta-hCG levels in maternal serum, amniotic fluid and fetal serum from 17 pregnancies with fetal trisomy 21 and 131 unaffected control pregnancies were measured between 16 to 28 weeks gestation using radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: In these pregnancies with fetal trisomy 21, the AFP and uE3 levels in maternal serum, amniotic fluid and fetal serum were lower than those in controls; but beta-hCG levels were higher (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: To measure maternal serum AFP, uE3 and beta-hCG levels will be useful in prenatal detection of trisomy 21.
