Fetal gender: antenatal discrepancy between phenotype and genotype.
Sexual discrepancy is reported in both 46,XY females and 46,XX males, and most diagnoses of sex reversal are made in the postpubertal period. We report three cases of sexual discrepancy, which were revealed by karyotyping following genetic amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling and fetal blood sampling. The etiologies of 46,XX male, 45,X male and 46,XY female subjects are reviewed. When sexual discrepancy between fetal karyotype and ultrasonographic fetal phenotype is encountered, sample error and placental mosaicism should be excluded. A detailed fetal ultrasound examination should be performed to check for syndromic gender discrepancy. When repeat karyotyping is indicated, localization of the Sox related Y chromosome gene should be carried out.
