Stability of aneuploidy rate in polar bodies in two cohorts from the same patient.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of the aneuploidy rate of the first polar body. Knowing the stability of the oocyte aneuploidy rate for each patient would allow the first analysis to be used as a prognostic tool for further attempts at intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). After a first unsuccessful ICSI attempt with preconceptional screening, 24 women underwent a second attempt. First polar body aneuploidy rates were compared in the course of two successive ovarian stimulations. The first polar body was biopsied after laser dissection of the zona pellucida and five chromosomes were analysed using the MultiVysion polar body multicolour probe panel. A total of 200 polar bodies were analysed; 91 and 109 in the first and second ICSI attempts, respectively. The total aneuploidy rate was identical in the first and second attempts; 44.0% (40/91) and 44.0% (48/109), respectively. The first evaluation of the aneuploidy rate was statistically (P = 0.0007) correlated with the second, with a correlation coefficient, r = 0.707. The stability of the aneuploidy rate in different cohorts from the same patient, if confirmed in a larger series, makes this parameter a useful tool for counselling couples.
