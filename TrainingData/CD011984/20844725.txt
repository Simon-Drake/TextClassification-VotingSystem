Current trends in Antenatal Screening Services: Results from a regional survey.
OBJECTIVE: To identify variations in current antenatal screening programmes across one region and compare results with a previous survey. DESIGN: A cross section descriptive survey. SETTING: All maternity units within the region of Northern Ireland. SAMPLE: Eleven maternity units were invited and ten agreed to participate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of written policies for individual screening tests; the range of screening tests offered; the frequency of training opportunities for health professionals; and the information systems in place to record data. RESULTS: There is variation in service provision across maternity units and, in particular, inconsistency in the offer of serum screening tests for Down syndrome. A lack of training opportunities for health professionals involved in offering screening was highlighted, and no common information system employed. CONCLUSION: While improvements have been made since 2002, variations persist. This is leading to inequalities in the provision of antenatal screening services across Northern Ireland.
