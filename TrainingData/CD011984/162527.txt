Prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis: first 1,000 successful cases.
From February 1969 to August 1976, we studied 1,048 amniotic fluids. Of these, 958 (91.4%) were primarily for prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis. Cytogenetic studies were attempted in 1,021 cases; the diagnosis was successful in 1,000 of these. The failure rate of obtaining a diagnosis from the amniotic fluid cell culture of the first amniocentesis was 5% (50 cases); 29 cases had a repeat tap and successful diagnosis was achieved in all. In 21 cases, a repeat tap was refused. Thus, the overall failure rate of obtaining a final cytogenetic diagnosis was 2.06% (21/1,021). There were 32 fetal losses after amniocentesis including 16 spontaneous second trimester abortions, 7 fetal deaths in utero and 9 stillbirths. In two additional cases, fetal death had occurred before amniocentesis. This number of fetal losses does not exceed the number that would be expected in the same maternal age group without amniocentesis. In our series, the frequencies of trisomy in maternal age groups 40 years and over, 37-39 years, 35-36 years, and under 35 years were 4.5, 3.14, 0 and 0% respectively. These frequencies are comparable to those reported from other prospective prenatal studies and higher than those of retrospective live born studies. Various problems and pitfalls in prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis are discussed.
