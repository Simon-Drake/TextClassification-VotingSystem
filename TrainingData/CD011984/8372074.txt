Follow-up of pregnancies complicated by placental mosaicism diagnosed by chorionic villus sampling.
Thirty-nine (2.3 per cent) of 1724 chromosome studies from diagnostic chorionic villus samplings (CVS) done between 1983 and 1990 showed either level III (true) mosaicism (1.2 per cent) or level II (pseudo-) mosaicism (1.1 per cent) for chromosomal aneuploidy. Follow-up information on these 39 pregnancies was collected from questionnaires to families, paediatricians, and obstetricians. For all cases in which the pregnancy was continued and further testing was accomplished, the mosaicism was felt to be confined to the placenta. As compared with a control group of pregnancies evaluated by CVS with normal karyotypes, there was no increased incidence of pregnancy loss, congenital malformations, or developmental delay in the infants. Although intrauterine growth retardation occurred in several of the level III mosaic cases, adequate catch-up growth has been demonstrated.
