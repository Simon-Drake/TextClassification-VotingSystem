Increased aneuploidy in spermatozoa from testicular tumour patients after chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin.
Testicular cancer is the most common neoplasia occurring in the young male population. The PEB (cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin) adjuvant chemotherapy usually proposed after orchidectomy in non seminomatous tumours, and in metastatic seminomas, has improved the long-term survival of these patients. Following an azoospermic period, sperm cell recovery is generally observed after treatment delivery, but little is known about the genetic consequences on these new spermatozoa. To estimate the chromosomal consequences of this chemotherapy on sperm cells during the period of recovery of spermatogenesis, sperm cell aneuploidy was studied in testicular cancer patients, at 6-18 months after PEB adjuvant chemotherapy delivery, using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) of chromosomes 7, 16, 18, X and Y with specific DNA probes. A significant increase in the frequency of diploidy and disomy for chromosomes 16, 18 and XY was observed in treated patients compared with a healthy control group. Spermatozoa aneuploidy occurring during the spermatogenesis recovery period might be a possible side effect of the PEB regimen. Thus, practitioners should be advised to provide counselling about the need for an appropriate duration of contraception. Moreover, genetic counselling should be offered in cases of pregnancy occurring soon after the end of chemotherapy.
