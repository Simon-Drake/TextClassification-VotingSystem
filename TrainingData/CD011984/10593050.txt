[Reduction in malformation-related early mortality--a possibility for modifying perinatal mortality].
From 1980 to 1996 1.8% of all births died as a result of malformations during the first week of life. This rate has been declining significantly after 1992. Congenital malformations of the heart have increased significantly because of improved diagnostic methods. From 1980 to 1996 0.67/1000 of all children died of vitium cordis during the first week of life. From 1992 to 1996 this group of malformations increased the perinatal mortality rate by 0.4/1000. There is a decreased mortality rate of neural tube defects by 0.25/1000 1980 to 1986 and by 0.08/1000 1992 to 1996. Trisomy 21: the early mortality rate decreased from 0.07/1000 to 0.03/1000. The number of non-deceased children with Down's syndrome remains constant, even though 40 per cent of all cases with trisomy 21 were prenatal. 3 per cent of all malformed newborn died during the first week of life as a result of their congenital malformations. The possibility of primary prevention of malformations with folic acid has not been sufficiently utilised.
