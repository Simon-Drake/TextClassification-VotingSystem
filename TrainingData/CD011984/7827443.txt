Complex genetic counseling and exclusion of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in a twin pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF).
A twin pregnancy following in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer coincidentally at risk for the X-linked recessive Duchenne muscular dystrophy is described. First-trimester prenatal diagnosis by transabdominal chorionic villus samplings on the dichorionic placentae and molecular linkage analysis could exclude the disorder in both fetuses. Genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis were particularly complex due to the twin pregnancy, the need for linkage analysis, and confined placental mosaicism 45,X/46XX in one of the fetuses. All parties should be aware that additional invasive diagnostic procedures in the second trimester might be required. It is proposed that, in similar situations, only one, arguably two, fertilized egg be transferred at a time to facilitate prenatal diagnosis and decision making for these rare couples. This problem, however, may be increasingly overcome by preimplantation diagnosis.
