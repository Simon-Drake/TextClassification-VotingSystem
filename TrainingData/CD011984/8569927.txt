[Serum screening in pregnant women for Down syndrome and open neural-tube defects; testing against the Health Council criteria for genetic screening].
OBJECTIVE: To check whether serum screening for Down syndrome and open neural tube defects satisfies the criteria set by the 'Committee Genetic screening' of the Dutch Health Council. DESIGN: Theoretical evaluation. METHOD: Serum screening (the combined serum assessment of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotrophin and unconjugated oestriol, taking into consideration maternal age) was assessed against the Dutch Health Council criteria. The absolute criteria could be subdivided into a group of general conditions not related to a particular screening programme, and a group of programme-specific conditions. RESULTS: Population serum screening satisfied some of the absolute criteria, while the programme-specific conditions should be realised in an actual screening programme. Psychological and community consequences of such a screening have not yet been investigated in the Dutch population.
