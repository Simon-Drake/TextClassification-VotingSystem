Brachycephaly is ineffective for detection of Down syndrome in early midtrimester fetuses.
The aim of this study was to assess the value of fetal brachycephaly in the detection of Down syndrome at 13-18 weeks of pregnancy. The cephalic index (CI) was determined in 555 consecutive chromosomally normal fetuses, and in 38 chromosomal abnormalities, prior to amniocentesis. A CI > 0.85 was observed in 14% (2/14) of the fetuses with Down syndrome and in 11% of the normal fetuses. In conclusion, our data show that brachycephaly is not a useful marker for Down syndrome in early midtrimester fetuses.
