Use of videotapes for viewing at home to inform choice in Down syndrome screening: a randomised controlled trial.
A randomised trial was carried out to assess the effect of a Down syndrome screening video on test uptake, knowledge and psychological stress. A total of 2000 women referred for antenatal care were allocated to two equal groups: one to be sent a video to their home, before their hospital booking visit, and a control group. All women also received screening information in the form of a leaflet before booking and from a midwife at booking. The video had no effect on the screening uptake rate: 638/993 (64.2%) and 652/1007 (64.7%) in the video and control groups, respectively. Women were requested to return the video for reuse in other pregnancies and 612 (62%) did so. A subset of 1200 women were selected to be posted at 17-19 weeks' gestation a self-completed questionnaire to assess the psychological endpoints. Knowledge of screening was increased in the video group with a mean score of 7.3 compared with 6.7 in the controls, a statistically significant difference (t=3.24, p=0.0005). There were no significant differences between the groups in specific worries about abnormalities in the baby, and general anxiety. We conclude that a video can increase knowledge without affecting the uptake of the test, or psychological stress.
