Prenatal maternal serum screening during the second trimester of pregnancy using the Triple Test in Luxembourg.
Starting in 1991, it is now an established practice in Luxembourg to use prenatal maternal serum screening during the second trimester of pregnancy. Its reliability has been investigated. Half of the pregnant population is screened, with a call back rate (false positive rate) of 5.4%. The sensitivity of the screening is 81.5%, the specificity 94.6%, with a PPV of 1.5% and a NPV of 99.9%. This is in good agreement with international findings.
