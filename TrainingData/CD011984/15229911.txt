Maxillary length at 11-14 weeks of gestation in fetuses with trisomy 21.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of measuring maxillary length at 11-14 weeks of gestation in screening for trisomy 21. METHODS: In 970 fetuses ultrasound examination was carried out for measurement of crown-rump length (CRL), nuchal translucency and maxillary length, and to determine if the nasal bone was present or absent, immediately before chorionic villus sampling for karyotyping at 11-14 weeks of gestation. In 60 cases the maxillary length was measured twice by the same operator to calculate the intraobserver variation in measurements. RESULTS: The median gestation was 12 (range, 11-14) weeks. The maxilla was successfully examined in all cases. The mean difference between paired measurements of maxillary length was -0.012 mm and the 95% limits of agreement were -0.42 (95% CI, -0.47 to -0.37) to 0.40 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.44) mm. The fetal karyotype was normal in 839 pregnancies and abnormal in 131, including 88 cases of trisomy 21. In the chromosomally normal group the maxillary length increased significantly with CRL from a mean of 4.8 mm at a CRL of 45 mm to 8.3 mm at a CRL of 84 mm. In the trisomy 21 fetuses the maxillary length was significantly shorter than normal by 0.7 mm and in the trisomy 21 fetuses with absent nasal bone the maxilla was shorter than in those with present nasal bone by 0.5 mm. In fetuses with other chromosomal defects there were no significant differences from normal in the maxillary length. CONCLUSION: At 11-14 weeks of gestation, maxillary length in trisomy 21 fetuses is significantly shorter than in normal fetuses.
