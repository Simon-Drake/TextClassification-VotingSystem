Histopathological findings of the nose of Down syndrome abortuses.
Recent reports of absent nasal bone in fetuses with Down syndrome have sparked much interest in the use of this finding for the screening of Down syndrome. We describe the histopathological findings of nasal bones of two fetuses with Down syndrome, one with absence and the other with normal ossification of the nasal bone. We propose that histopathological examination of the nasal bone could improve the accuracy of diagnosis of nasal hypoplasia among Down syndrome abortuses.
