First trimester umbilical artery pulsatility index in fetuses presenting enlarged nuchal translucency.
The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate an umbilical artery pulsatility index (UAPI) in first trimester fetuses who present enlarged nuchal translucency (NT) measurements. UAPI was measured in 121 single fetuses with NT > or =95th centile, from 10+3 to 13+6 weeks (crown-rump length (CRL) > or =38 mm - < or =84 mm). In these fetuses there were 20 trisomy 21, and six other chromosomal abnormalities (three trisomy 18 and three monosomy X). Eighty-nine cases had normal karyotype and delivered a baby without evidence of congenital malformations. Five fetuses with normal karyotype assessed antenatally were excluded from the comparison, because of evidence of congenital malformation. A fetus with normal karyotype that was spontaneously miscarried at 14 weeks' after chorionic villus sampling was also excluded. UAPI of fetuses with enlarged NT was compared with those of 65 singleton fetuses with normal NT and normal karyotype, which were used to establish our terms of reference (5th centile, median and 95th centile). UAPI of 7/20 (35%) Down syndrome and 42/89 (47%) normal karyotype fetuses presenting enlarged NT were above the median, and respectively 2/20 (10%) and 14/89 (15.7%) were above 95th centile of normal NT and normal karyotype fetuses. No significant differences were demonstrated in the UAPI values amongst normal karyotype fetuses with normal NT or normal karyotype fetuses with an enlarged NT or trisomy 21 fetuses with an enlarged NT.
