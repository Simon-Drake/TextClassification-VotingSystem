Community-based screening for Down's Syndrome in the first trimester using ultrasound and maternal serum biochemistry.
Two years of community-based first trimester screening (FTS) were audited. All women with singleton pregnancy in a defined health region who completed FTS (ultrasound and biochemistry) were included (n= 10,436) and outcomes obtained for 98.4%. All scans were performed or supervised by experienced sonologists with Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) accreditation. FMF software generated all risk assessments based on nuchal translucency (NT), maternal serum-free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A). The detection rate for Trisomy 21 was 90.6% with a screen-positive rate of 3.9%. These findings indicate that where FTS is accessible within routine antenatal care, a detection rate of 90% and low screen-positive rate can be achieved using the FMF programme.
