Growth failure in second-trimester fetuses with trisomy 21.
Growth failure in the Down syndrome is common postnatally, but is thought to be less consistent in fetuses and newborns. We describe the growth of individual organs in 53 second-trimester abortuses with trisomy 21 and compare the organ weights to organ weights from 432 spontaneously aborted, but otherwise normal control specimens. Using multiple regression analysis, we found body weight to be the most significant predictor of all organ weights in normal fetuses; therefore, this variable was used to generate the regression lines to which the organ weights of trisomic specimens were compared. All trisomic fetal organs were found to be small, with an abnormal karyotype being a significant predictor of low organ weight. However, the effect on individual organs was variable, with some organs differing only minimally from the controls. Placental weights were not affected by fetal trisomy. This study demonstrates the presence of well-established, although variably severe, growth retardation in second-trimester fetuses with Down syndrome.
