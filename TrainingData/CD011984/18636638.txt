Genetic counseling for the 22q11.2 deletion.
Because of advances in palliative medical care, children with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are surviving into adulthood. An increase in reproductive fitness will likely follow necessitating enhanced access to genetic counseling for these patients and their families. Primary care physicians/obstetric practitioners are in a unique position to identify previously undiagnosed patients as they reach reproductive age and to refer them for genetic counseling. To date, most deletions are de novo, secondary to homologous recombination between low-copy repeat sequences located within 22q11.2. Nonetheless, both somatic and germ line mosaicism has been observed giving unaffected parents a small risk of recurrence. Once present though there is a 50% chance for a person with this contiguous deletion to have an affected child. With this in mind, a variety of prenatal monitoring techniques, as well as, preimplantation genetic diagnosis are available depending on the specific level of risk.
