Second-trimester maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal twin and singleton pregnancies: a report of local Chinese population.
OBJECTIVES: The study evaluated the differences between Chinese normal twin and singleton pregnancies in the levels of maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (free beta-hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) used in second-trimester Down syndrome (DS) screening. METHODS: The concentrations of maternal serum markers of 456 twin pregnancies and 12 067 singleton controls in gestational 15 to 20 weeks were measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay, and the levels of markers were compared between the twins and singletons. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the levels of free beta-hCG in twins and twice of those in singletons in 16, 17 and 19 gestational weeks (p < 0.05 for all); while considering AFP, significant differences were found in 16 and 19 gestational weeks (p < 0.05 for both). No correlations were found in twins between the levels of markers and maternal weights in most gestational weeks (Free beta-hCG: p > 0.05 for 15 to 18 and 20 gestational weeks; AFP: p > 0.05 for 16 to 20 gestational weeks). CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese gestational age-specific levels of maternal serum markers in normal twins are not twice as those in singletons. The current weight-correction model for DS screening may be not feasible for twins.
