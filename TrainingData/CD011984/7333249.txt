Epidemiologic detection of low dose effects on the developing fetus.
Evaluations of the health effects of exposures in the workplace and environment have broadened to include effects on reproduction, as well as on the development of cancer. Models to assess risks associated with varying doses of exposure rest almost entirely on data about cancer. In this paper we discuss some distinctive features of reproduction which bear on the interpretation of such models, when applied to reproduction, rather than carcinogenesis. Dose-response curves describe the relationship between two exposures (smoking and alcohol drinking) and two outcomes (spontaneous abortion and birthweight) are used to illustrate some of the questions which arise in attempting to determine a "safe" level of exposure.
