Examination of trisomy 13, 18 and 21 foetal tissues at different gestational ages using FISH.
In man high levels of aneuploidy are seen in spontaneous abortions. Very few autosomal trisomies survive to birth, the three most common being those for chromosome 13, 18 and 21 giving rise to the syndromes named Patau, Edwards and Down respectively. Since the majority of these spontaneously abort, what makes the survivors different from the aborters? Could it be that they have tissue specific mosaicism with the additional normal cell line supporting survival? In this study fluorescence in situ hybridisation was used as a convenient way to detect trisomy in interphase cells. To study the level of mosaicism across gestation, different tissues from 21 trisomic foetuses were analysed using probes for chromosome 13, 18, 21, X and Y. Two trisomy 18 foetuses exhibited mosaicism. Two others, one trisomy 13 and one trisomy 18 had mosaic placentas. There was no clear association between the limited mosaicism seen and severity of the phenotype. We conclude that at least for this sample set, tissue-specific mosaicism was not likely to be responsible for potential survival to birth.
