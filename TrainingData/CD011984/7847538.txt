Third-trimester hyperechogenic bowel in Down syndrome.
The association between second-trimester hyperechogenic bowel and Down syndrome has been well established in the literature. In this report we present a case of Down syndrome in which this finding was only detected during the third-trimester scan, after normal bowel echogenicity was documented in the second trimester. This report suggests that hyperechogenic bowel could be a late manifestation of Down syndrome.
