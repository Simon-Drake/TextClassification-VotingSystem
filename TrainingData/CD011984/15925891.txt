Detection of chromosome abnormalities by quantitative fluorescent PCR in ectopic pregnancies.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential value of quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) in the detection of chromosome abnormalities in ectopic pregnancies. METHODS: Seventy chorionic villi samples of ectopic pregnancies were studied by QF-PCR. Primers for chromosomes 16, 21, X and Y in chorionic villi were evaluated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed when results of QF-PCR showed aneuploidy, in case of unexplicable QF-PCR peaks, and in 10 cases with normal QF-PCR results. RESULTS: QF-PCR produced a result for chromosomes X and Y in 66 cases (94%), for chromosome 16 in 62 cases (89%) and for chromosome 21 in 55 cases (79%). Overall, QF-PCR produced a result for the chromosomes tested in 54 ectopic pregnancy cases (77%). Fifty-two of these results were normal disomic (96%) and two were abnormal, one trisomy 16 (2%) and one triploidy (2%). In 16 cases (23%) no definite QF-PCR results could be obtained for all chromosomes, 11 due to amplification failure, and 5 due to unexplicable QF-PCR peaks. In 10 cases with normal QF-PCR results, disomy was confirmed by FISH. The trisomy 16 was also confirmed by FISH. Furthermore, a result was obtained with FISH in 5 of the cases without definite QF-PCR results. CONCLUSION: Although QF-PCR can establish the chromosomal status in ectopic pregnancies for chromosomes 16, 21, X and Y in the majority of cases, the technical failure rate is still considerable and does not improve results when compared to cytogenetic techniques.
