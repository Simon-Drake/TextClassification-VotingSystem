Asynchronous replication of allelic loci in Down syndrome.
We have used FISH to determine the level of synchronisation in replication timing of four pairs of alleles, unrelated to chromosome 21 (p53, HER2, RB1, and c-myc), in foetal (amniotic fluid) cell samples of Down syndrome and in normal foetuses. All samples derived from the Down syndrome subjects showed large temporal differences in replication timing, in contrast to the high level of synchrony shown in all samples of normal individuals. Thus, as judged by four independent loci which are not associated with chromosome 21, the additional chromosome in the Down syndrome genome induces changes in the replication pattern of an allelic pair: from a synchronous pattern characteristic to concomitantly expressed alleles to an unsynchronised one shown by alleles displaying an allele-specific mode of expression.
