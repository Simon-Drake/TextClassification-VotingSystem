Viable pregnancies after diagnosis of trisomy 16 by CVS: lethal aneuploidy compartmentalized to the trophoblast.
Increasing utilization of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) has lead to the discovery that the placenta can karyotypically be a very heterogeneous organ, and chromosomal mosaicism within the placental can confuse cytogenetic interpretation. Recently, confined placental mosaicism (confined regions of aneuploidy in the otherwise normal diploid placental and fetus) has been described involving a number of chromosomal abnormalities. Fetal trisomy 16 is considered uniformly lethal early in gestation. However, we present 3 cases of nonmosaic trisomy 16 confined regionally to the placenta. We discuss the possible etiology, impact on the developing fetus, and suggest an approach to the workup and evaluation of cases where the karyotype obtained on CVS is not compatible with the findings on ultrasound.
