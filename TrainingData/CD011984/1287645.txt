Prenatal diagnosis of tetrasomy 12p by in situ hybridization: varying levels of mosaicism in different fetal tissues.
Prenatal diagnosis of tetrasomy 12p is complicated by the discrimination of the 12p isochromosome from the duplication 21q as well as the level of mosaicism demonstrated in the particular tissue sampled. In this disease, a high percentage of chromosomally abnormal cells are generally found in fibroblastic cells, but lymphocyte karyotypes from the same individual may be normal. We report on the pregnancy of a 37-year-old female who presented to our centre at 16 weeks' gestation for genetic amniocentesis. Sonography of the fetus revealed dextrocardia and diaphragmatic hernia. Chromosome analysis of amniocytes demonstrated mosaicism of a 47,XY,+i(12p) line in 80 per cent of cells and a normal male line (20 per cent), consistent with the Pallister-Killian syndrome. Following termination, a 220 g male fetus of 18 weeks was examined. A flattened nose and low-set ears were noted. In situ hybridization with a chromosome 12 centromeric probe in lymphocytes and skin cells unequivocally confirmed the karyotype and showed the presence of a single centromere in the abnormal chromosome, suggesting a true isochromosome. Chromosome analysis of various fetal tissues was performed and the following percentages of abnormal cells were found: skin 100 per cent, chorion 50 per cent, placenta 30 per cent, and blood 80 per cent. The high frequency of tetrasomic cells in fetal blood at this early gestational age is noteworthy, since most reports of this syndrome show a very low percentage of abnormal cells postnatally.
