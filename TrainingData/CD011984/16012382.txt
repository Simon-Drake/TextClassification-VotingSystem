[Role of "subtle" ultrasonographic signs during antenatal screening for trisomy 21 during the second trimester of pregnancy: meta-analysis and CPDPN protocol of the Grenoble University Hospital].
OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis about subtle ultrasonographic signs in second trimester of pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 196 articles dealing with the subject--from 1985 to July 2002--were studied. Data on the 11 reported signs were collected from 92 theoretically and/or statistically valid studies. Then, the studies were selected according to several criteria: isolated characteristic, defined thresholds, calculable sensitivity and specificity. After checking for homogeneity, a likelihood ratio was calculated for some of the signs. RESULTS: This meta-analysis of the second trimester ultrasonographic signs of Down's syndrome enabled us to estimate the likelihood ratio (LHR) of six signs. At 22 weeks'gestation (WG) these signs are: pyelectasis equal to or greater than 5 mm; nuchal fold thickness equal to or greater than 6 mm; persistence of choroid plexus cysts; shortness of the femur and humerus below the tenth percentile; hyperechogenic bowe; and nasal bone length less than 2.5 mm. CONCLUSION: These validated ultrasonographic signs are independent of nuchal translucency thickness at 12 WG and of maternal serum biochemistry. This allows to calculate a combinate risk for nuchal translucency, maternal serum biochemistry and second trimester ultrasonographic signs when they are validated.
