Human chromosome 21-encoded cDNA clones.
We have employed two strategies to isolate random cDNA clones encoded by chromosome 21. In the first approach, a cDNA library representing expressed genes of WA17, a mouse-human somatic cell hybrid carrying chromosome 21 as its sole human chromosome, was screened with total human DNA to identify human chromosome 21-specific cDNAs. The second approach utilized previously characterized single-copy genomic fragments from chromosome 21 as probes to retrieve homologous coding sequences from a human fetal brain cDNA library. Six cDNA clones on chromosome 21 were obtained in this manner. Two were localized to the proximal long arm of chromosome 21, two to the distal portion of the long arm, and one to the region of 21q22 implicated in the pathology of Down syndrome.
