Maternal decision to terminate pregnancy in case of Down syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: This study explores decisional processes regarding termination of pregnancy because of Down syndrome and aims to identify possibilities for improving counseling. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-one women completed questionnaires 4 months after termination of pregnancy for Down syndrome, including motivations for the decision, reasons for doubt, perceived influence and/or pressure at decision-making, and satisfaction with the received health care. RESULTS: Child-related motivations to the termination were the most frequently mentioned, but almost all women indicated also motives of self-interest. Twenty-one percent of women reported much doubt. Perceived influence of the medical staff was substantial, but most women felt that they had not been put under pressure. Satisfaction with the caregivers was high. CONCLUSION: Women acknowledge that self-interested motives play an important role. Medical caregivers are among the most important persons for women who decide to terminate pregnancy because of Down syndrome.
