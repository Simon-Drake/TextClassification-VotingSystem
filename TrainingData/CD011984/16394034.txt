Screening for Down syndrome: practice patterns and knowledge of obstetricians and gynecologists.
OBJECTIVE: To assess obstetricians' practice patterns and knowledge regarding screening for Down syndrome. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to 1,105 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Fellows and Junior Fellows in 2004. RESULTS: Sixty percent of questionnaires were returned. Statistical analyses were limited to the 532 practicing obstetricians. Greater than 80% felt their training and experience qualified them to counsel patients about genetic issues in pregnancy. However, 45% rated their residency training regarding prenatal diagnosis as barely adequate or nonexistent. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists publications were rated by 86% as an important source of information on genetic counseling. Seventy-eight percent of practitioners counsel all obstetric patients about risks for fetal aneuploidy, and 67% provide counseling for heritable genetic abnormalities. Although the majority (99%) offer second-trimester Down syndrome screening, only 55% also offer first-trimester screening for Down syndrome. Almost one half (49%) use the quad screen, and 6% offer integrated first- and second-trimester screening. The majority (88%) routinely offer amniocentesis to patients who are at elevated risk for genetic abnormalities, whereas 44% also offer chorionic villus sampling. Few (2%) perform chorionic villus sampling. CONCLUSION: Most obstetricians manage patients at risk for fetal genetic abnormalities according to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists educational materials. This survey identified deficiencies related to Down syndrome screening, including a limited number of practitioners performing chorionic villus sampling and physicians' own perception that training regarding genetic counseling should be improved. Educational strategies are needed to address these deficiencies before first-trimester screening programs are widely implemented. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.
