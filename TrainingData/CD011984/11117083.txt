Femur length and trisomy 21: impact of gestational age on screening efficiency.
OBJECTIVE: This study assesses two methods used to define relatively short femur in screening for trisomy 21 and examines changes in performance of screening with gestational age. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data on menstrual age, femur length (FL) and biparietal diameter (BPD) in 49 trisomy 21 pregnancies and 6069 normal controls. Reference ranges were derived for BPD/FL versus menstrual age and for FL versus BPD. Two methods of defining short femur (BPD/FL and observed-to-expected FL ratio) were examined for false-positive rates and detection rates for trisomy 21 at different gestational ages. RESULTS: In the control group the BPD/FL ratio and its standard deviation decreased with menstrual age. Trisomy 21 was associated with a significantly higher BPD/FL ratio (P < 0.001) and the deviation increased significantly with menstrual age (P < 0.05). Eleven percent of 28 fetuses examined at 15-17 weeks had a BPD/FL above the 95th centile compared with 24% of 21 fetuses examined at 18-20 weeks (P = 0.40). The median observed-to-expected FL ratio in the control group was 1.0 throughout the gestational age range but the standard deviation decreased significantly with menstrual age (P < 0.01). Trisomy 21 was associated with a significantly reduced observed-to-expected FL ratio (P < 0.001) and the deviation increased significantly with menstrual age (P < 0.05). A fixed cut-off of 0.91 for observed-to-expected FL ratio provided a false-positive rate of 12% at 15-17 weeks compared with 6% at 18-20 weeks of gestation (P < 0.001) with detection rates of 29 and 38%, respectively (P = 0.73). CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the definition used to define the condition, relatively short femur is a poor marker for trisomy 21 particularly when the assessment takes place before 18 weeks of gestation.
