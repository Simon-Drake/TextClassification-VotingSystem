Second trimester levels of maternal serum total activin A and placental inhibin/activin alpha and betaA subunit messenger ribonucleic acids in Down syndrome pregnancy.
OBJECTIVES: Previous data have shown that inhibin A (alpha/betaA) is increased about twofold in maternal serum samples from Down syndrome pregnancy. Our objectives were to determine whether activin A (betaA/betaA) was similarly increased in maternal serum from pregnancies affected with fetal Down syndrome, and to investigate whether increased expression of each inhibin/activin subunit occurred in placental tissue from cases of fetal Down syndrome. DESIGN AND METHODS: Maternal serum total activin A levels were measured in 20 cases of fetal Down syndrome and 100 unaffected pregnancy samples. In addition, analysis of inhibin/activin alpha and betaA subunit mRNA levels was performed in placental tissue extracts from six cases of fetal Down syndrome and six tissues with a normal karyotype. RESULTS: The median total activin A level in the Down syndrome cases was 0.82 MoM (multiples of the median); values did not differ significantly (P = 0.36, Mann-Whitney U analysis) from those in unaffected pregnancies. The inhibin alpha subunit/GAPDH mRNA ratio, but not that of betaA subunit/GAPDH mRNA, was significantly greater (P < 0.01, ANOVA) in placental tissue from Down syndrome than in control placental tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike inhibin A, activin A is not significantly increased in Down syndrome relative to unaffected pregnancy. Furthermore, increased amounts of maternal serum inhibin A in Down syndrome pregnancy probably result from increased placental expression of inhibin alpha, but not betaA, subunit.
