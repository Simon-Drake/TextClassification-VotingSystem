Isolated choroid plexus cyst(s): an indication for amniocentesis.
OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to prospectively evaluate the risk of chromosomal abnormalities associated with isolated choroid plexus cyst(s) in gravid women undergoing second-trimester ultrasonographic examination. STUDY DESIGN: During a 24-month period 9100 pregnant women underwent midtrimester ultrasonographic evaluation. Women with a fetal diagnosis of choroid plexus cyst(s) were offered amniocentesis and a repeat examination in 4 to 6 weeks. RESULTS: A diagnosis of choroid plexus cyst(s) was made in 102 fetuses (1.1%). In four of these fetuses multiple congenital anomalies were noted. Three of the four fetuses had a chromosomal abnormality, two trisomy 18 and one unbalanced translocation, t(3;13). In the remaining 98 fetuses the choroid plexus cysts were isolated findings, that is, there were no other ultrasonographically detected anomalies. Seventy-five of these 98 fetuses underwent amniocentesis. An abnormal karyotype was identified in four fetuses: three had Down syndrome (two trisomy 21 and one unbalanced translocation, t[14;21]), and one trisomy 18. The offspring of the 23 patients in which amniocentesis was declined were phenotypically normal. CONCLUSIONS: In our prospective study the risk of chromosomal abnormality with isolated choroid plexus cyst(s) was 1:25, a risk that exceeds the 1:200 risk of pregnancy loss after amniocentesis and the 1:126 and 1:260 risk for aneuploidy and Down syndrome, respectively, in a 35-year-old pregnant women during the midtrimester. These findings indicate that amniocentesis should be offered to pregnant women in the presence of isolated fetal choroid plexus cyst(s).
