Down syndrome screening in the United States in 2001 and 2007: a survey of maternal-fetal medicine specialists.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine changes in screening and performance of invasive diagnostic procedures for Down syndrome between 2001 and 2007. STUDY DESIGN: The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine members completed a survey in 2007 regarding screening tests and diagnostic procedures for Down syndrome. With the use of descriptive statistics, the chi(2) test, and the Student t test, responses from 2007 were compared with responses from a similar 2001 survey. RESULTS: Performance of first-trimester screening more than doubled from 2001-2007 (43.1% in 2001, 97.3% in 2007; P < .0001). Between 2001 and 2007, the use of the quad screen increased 10-fold (8.5% in 2001, 85.6% in 2007; P < .0001). There was an estimated 20% decrease in invasive diagnostic procedures that were performed in risk-positive women (53.7% in 2001, 34.2% in 2007; P < .0001). In 2007, the average fetal loss rates that were quoted by maternal-fetal medicine specialists after chorionic villous sampling was 1:160 and after an amniocentesis was 1:493. CONCLUSION: Down syndrome screening evolved from 2001-2007, with an increasing emphasis on first-trimester screening. With more efficacious screening, the number of invasive procedures has declined.
