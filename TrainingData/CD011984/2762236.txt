Prenatal diagnosis of 45,X/46,XX mosaicism in the fetus. Should the pregnancy be terminated?
45,X/46,XX True mosaicism was found in the amniotic fluid cell culture study in our patient and was confirmed by rapid fetal blood karyotyping. Elective termination of the pregnancy revealed a morphologically normal female fetus with true mosaicism but no features of Turner's syndrome.
