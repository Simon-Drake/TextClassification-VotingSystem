Medians for second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol; differences between races or ethnic groups.
Second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and unconjugated estriol (uE3) are routinely measured in screening fetuses at high risk for Down syndrome or open neural tube defects (ONTD). For test interpretation, individual patient values of these three analytes are related to population-derived median values. We evaluated data from >21000 pregnancies to determine the extent of race-specific differences in median concentrations. For samples at most gestational ages, median AFP, hCG, and uE3 values for white, black, Hispanic, and other patients were all significantly different. Differences remained significant even when data were corrected for patient weights. For each analyte, the extent of the variation was not the same at different gestational ages. Differences in median values across race/ethnicity groups appear to have only a small impact in Down syndrome screening but it may be appropriate to use alternative sets of AFP medians or adjustment factors to AFP medians for some Asian populations receiving ONTD screening.
