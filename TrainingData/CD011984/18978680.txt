Preimplantation genetic screening: a survey of in vitro fertilization clinics.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine which US in vitro fertilization clinics provide preimplantation genetic screening for aneuploidy in treating infertility, and to explore clinic directors' attitudes toward this technique. METHODS: Online survey included 415 US assisted reproductive technology clinics. The survey had a valid response rate of 45% or 186 clinics. RESULTS: Nearly 68% of US in vitro fertilization clinics responding to the survey provided preimplantation genetic screening in an effort to increase success rates of fertility treatment. More than half of these in vitro fertilization clinics (56%) provided preimplantation genetic screening for advanced maternal age and the same percentage provided preimplantation genetic screening to treat repeated in vitro fertilization failure, whereas 66% provided preimplantation genetic screening to treat women with repeated miscarriage. Opinions of the effectiveness of preimplantation genetic screening for these indications varied widely, even among those providing it. Most directors (85%) of clinics providing preimplantation genetic screening believed that more data are needed to determine whether and to whom it should be offered. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of data supporting the use of preimplantation genetic screening for recurrent pregnancy loss, in vitro fertilization failure, and advanced maternal age, a majority of in vitro fertilization clinics in the United States offer preimplantation genetic screening for these purposes. There is significant support among clinic directors for more research into the effectiveness of preimplantation genetic screening and for professional guidelines in this area.
