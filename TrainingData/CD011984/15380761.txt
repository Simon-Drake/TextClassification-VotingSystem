[Chromosome abnormalities of spermatozoa].
Chromosome meiotic pairing during male meiosis is a major event for chromosome segregation during anaphase I and spermatogenesis normal process. Chromosome non-disjunctions responsible for aneuploidy in male gametes can be observed during the first and the second meiotic divisions. The analysis of sperm nuclei chromosome constitution is a major and indirect tool for assessing male meiotic non-disjunctions and the genesis of chromosomal abnormalities. This evaluation has been performed initially by the human sperm/hamster oocyte fusion assay and more recently by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Therefore, male populations with increased risk of aneuploidy for their progeny could be identified before entering an in vitro fertilization procedure, and depending on the potential risk a preimplantation or prenatal genetic diagnosis could be performed. For males with constitutional chromosome abnormalities, a specific genetic counselling could also be proposed.
