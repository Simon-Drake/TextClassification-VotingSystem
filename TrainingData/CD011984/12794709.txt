Margareta Mikkelsen.
Margareta Mikkelsen, a well-known Danish cytogeneticist, started to research autosome aberrations in 1959 and built the first chromosome laboratory at the University of Copenhagen with Anders Froland. In 1968, she developed a fully functional chromosome laboratory from scratch at the John F. Kennedy Institute (JFKI). Not only the laboratory performed diagnoses all over Denmark, but also it is a sole place among all the departments of human genetics to train Danes to be clinical geneticists. A generation of Danish geneticists grew up under Dr. Mikkelsen's wing. Dr. Mikkelsen played a pioneering role in research on Down syndrome (DS) and exploring the source of the extra chromosome 21 remains her main interest. She performed the first case of prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis in Denmark and since then, she was active in this field. The JFKI also committed to research on the fragile X syndrome. Dr. Mikkelsen took on many public responsibilities in Denmark and in Europe. She was on the board of many Danish scientific organizations and an active member of the European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). She was efficient in public education with communication in lay language. After her retirement, she was more dynamic in medical ethics. Born as Irmtraud Wieser in Munich, Dr. Mikkelsen walked through the hardship of pre-war Germany, the inferno of the World War II, the trauma brought by her two husbands' alienation, the obstacles in work, and physical ailment to fulfill her unwavering commitment to human genetics.
