Intrauterine detection of Ebstein's anomaly and Down's syndrome. Prenatal diagnosis of a rare combination.
Ebstein's anomaly, although the most common malformation of the tricuspid valve, is a rare disease. Its association with other syndromes and extracardiac anomalies is very rare and has been reported in only a few cases. A case of prenatal diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly in a patient with Down's syndrome is reported.
