Tetrasomy 12p (Pallister-Killian syndrome): difficulties in prenatal diagnosis.
PURPOSE: We report a rare case of Pallister-Killian syndrome diagnosed prenatally with increased nuchal translucency during screening for trisomy 21. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Echografic and postmortem examination of the fetus, G-banded chromosome and FISH analysis on short- and long-term chorion villous sampling (CVS) culture. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Cytogenetic analysis revealed a supernumerary isochromosome 12p after long-term culture whereas a normal cell line was detected in short-term culture only. Sonografic examination in 17-weeks' gestation showed further increase of the NT and the additional presence of brachymelia, diaphragmatic hernia and a marked dextroposition of the heart. Termination of the pregnancy was performed. The cases of PKS karyotypically confirmed on CVS are reviewed, and cytogenetic and sonographic aspects of the prenatal diagnosis of PKS are discussed.
