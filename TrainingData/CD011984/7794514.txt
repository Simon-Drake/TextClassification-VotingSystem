Fetal hepatosplenomegaly associated with transient myeloproliferative disorder in trisomy 21.
The in utero diagnosis of fetal myeloproliferative disease was made by cordocentesis following the ultrasound appearance of fetal hepatosplenomegaly and mild hydrops. The 2 fetuses reported both had leukocyte counts greater than 75,000/mm3 with a predominance of blast forms. In both cases the karyotype revealed trisomy 21.
