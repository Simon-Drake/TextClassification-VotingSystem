Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 20 mosaicism indicating esophageal and rectal origin.
Trisomy 20 mosaicism in cultured amniotic fluid cells has in only a few cases been confirmed in fetal tissue. This may lead to the assumption that the trisomic cells are of extra-fetal origin and interruption of the pregnancy is not advisable. Chromosome analysis of numerous fetal tissues indicated in two cases the presence of one or more trisomy 20 cell clones in rectum and esophagus, respectively. The clinical significance of trisomy 20 mosaicism in single organs remains to be elucidated. Besides the karyotype, genetic counselling should take into account all accessible information of the pregnancy, e.g. ultra-sound, serum alpha-fetoprotein values and obstetrical history.
