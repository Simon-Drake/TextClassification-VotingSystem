[Amniocentesis for antenatal diagnosis. A report on an initial series of 180 cases (author's transl)].
The results are presented of amniocentesis for diagnostic genetic purposes in 180 patients. A diagnosis was obtainable in 170 cases (94%). Genetic abnormalities were detected in 11 cases; one patient miscarried 3 days after amniocentesis. Antenatal diagnosis of certain genetic disorders can be considered a routine method nowadays and should be offered to any woman at risk. It therefore seems necessary to supply the practitioners with the relevant information on this topic.
