Amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase activity and alpha-fetoprotein in chromosomal anomalies and neural tube defects.
Measurement of alpha-fetoprotein concentration and acetylcholinesterase activity in amniotic fluid can be used to identify chromosomal defects as well as neural tube defects. In seven cases of trisomy 21 and one case of partial trisomy 3, alpha-fetoprotein concentrations were below the reference range but values for acetylcholinesterase activity were normal for the appropriate gestational age. One case of trisomy 13 had an increase in acetylcholinesterase activity and normal alpha-fetoprotein concentration.
