Prenatal diagnosis of 45,X and 45,X mosaicism: the need for thorough cytogenetic and clinical evaluations.
OBJECTIVES: Mosaicism involving a 45,X cell line is relatively common in prenatal diagnosis. In prenatally diagnosed cases, the prognosis of non-mosaic 45,X and 45,X/46,XY mosaicism are different. Therefore, accurate identification of a cell line containing Y chromosome is critical for genetic counseling and postnatal management. METHODS: We investigated the ultrasound findings and outcomes of pregnancies with a 45,X cell line identified during mid-trimester cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 105 cases were found to have a 45,X cell line by standard cytogenetic analysis. Seventy-four cases were found to have non-mosaic 45,X at initial diagnosis. Of these 74 cases, 68 had abnormal ultrasound findings that were characteristic of Turner syndrome. Of the six cases with normal ultrasound findings, ultrasound examination was normal with male genitalia identified in three cases. Thorough cytogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis identified Y chromosome material in all three cases, one with a dicentric Y;14 chromosome and the other two cases with a marker chromosome containing Sex-determining Region (SRY) material in a small portion of the cells. In contrast, in 31 cases with a mosaic 45,X karyotype, ultrasound abnormality was identified only in one case. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest the need for follow-up ultrasound examination and thorough cytogenetic and molecular analysis for Y chromosome material in 45,X cases with normal ultrasound findings.
