Mosaic tetrasomy 15q25-->qter in a newborn infant with multiple anomalies.
We describe a premature boy with metopic craniosynostosis, facial anomalies, atrial-septal defect, hydronephrosis and flexion contractures of lower limbs, and mosaic tetrasomy 15q25-->qter. The extra chromosome material was present in the form of an acentric marker. A number of clinical manifestations observed in this child were also found in 3 previously reported patients who were trisomic for the same part of chromosome 15 and in 2 patients who were tetrasomic for a larger segment of 15q.
