Balanced reciprocal translocations: risk factors for aneuploid segregant viability.
Reciprocal translocations were studied in two groups of balanced carrier couples: 202 had 210 translocation aneuploid between (LB) infants, and 95 couples had repetitive abortions (AB) without liveborn aneuploids. The observed translocation aneuploidies in the LB group were compared to predicted potential aneuploidies in AB by frequency of chromosome involvement, meiotic segregation mode, and mean trisomic, monosomic and combined genomic imbalances. Qualitative and quantitative differences identified genomic regions and chromosomes possibly vital for in utero survivability. LB aneuploidies indicate non-random chromosome involvement, selection of least detrimental segregants and segments, and predominant transmission from maternal balanced carriers (especially in 3:1 tertiary segregation, 93.5%). For an individual with a balanced reciprocal translocation and untested reproductive capability, an approach is given for predicting whether a translocation aneuploid conceptus will be liveborn or aborted.
