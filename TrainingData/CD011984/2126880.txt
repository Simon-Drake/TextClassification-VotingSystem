[Cost-benefit analysis of amniocentesis in the prenatal diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities].
The article presents a cost-benefit analysis of amniocentesis for detection of chromosomal anomalies based on data (1985/87) collected in the Marseille area. In this geographic area, it is possible to confront, in an exhaustive manner, pregnant women's access to amniocentesis and incidence of fetal anomalies due to chromosomal aberrations. Results show that prenatal diagnosis is highly cost-beneficial, the average cost of one "avoided" case of Down's syndrome being lower than the lifelong costs of care for such a child. However, the study emphasizes that the cost-benefit ratio is highly sensitive to the implicit value society affects to the loss of "normal" fetuses through spontaneous abortions provoked by amniocentesis and because of terminations of pregnancy following diagnosis of minor fetal anomalies. The study also shows that lowering maternal age limit for access to free-of-charge amniocentesis from the current 38 years of age to 35 would have been cost-beneficial. Such lowering of the maternal age limit is discussed and compared with other indications which might be used for systematic access to amniocentesis.
