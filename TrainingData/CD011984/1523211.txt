Canadian multicenter randomized clinical trial of chorion villus sampling and amniocentesis. chromosome mosaicism in CVS and amniocentesis samples.
Data on 1040 chorionic villus and 969 amniotic fluid samples were collected from women studied in the Canadian Multicentre Randomized Clinical Trial of Chorion Villus Sampling and Amniocentesis. Cytogenetic results were obtained from 98.0 per cent of chorionic villus samples and from 99.9 per cent of amniotic fluid samples. Level I mosaicism (a single cell with an abnormal karyotype) occurred frequently in both chorionic villus and amniotic fluid samples and appeared to have no clinical significance. Level II mosaicism occurred in 0.9 per cent of CVS mesenchyme and 1.5 per cent of amniotic fluid cultures and in general was not perceived to be of sufficient concern to warrant cytogenetic follow-up studies. Level III mosaicism was reported in 18 CVS cases (15 cytotrophoblast, 1 mesenchyme, and 2 with both cell methods) and in one amniotic fluid case. In all cases but one (fetus with trisomy 18), level III mosaicism was confined to the placenta. Maternal cell contamination occurring with a frequency of 6.4 per cent in the mesenchyme analyses was a concern. This study supports the final report of the Canadian Multicentre Randomized Clinical Trial of Chorion Villus Sampling and Amniocentesis. Cytogenetic analysis of chorionic villus samples appears to be an acceptable alternative to the analysis of amniotic fluid samples. However, because of mosaicism and maternal cell contamination concerns, the examination of both cytotrophoblast preparations and mesenchyme cultures from chorionic villus samples is recommended.
