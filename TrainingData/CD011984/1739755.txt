The contribution of DNA analysis to carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia A and B.
Developments in DNA technology have provided a novel means of carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia A and B. The collection of a large set of data has enabled us to evaluate the present feasibility and reliability of a diagnosis at the gene level and its contribution to methods already available. Since 1984, 533 potential and obligate carriers belonging to 170 families with hemophilia have been referred to us. By the combined use of pedigree analysis, coagulation assays, and DNA (RFLP) analysis, certainty about the carrier status has been markedly increased for the potential carriers. Although RFLP analysis revealed the possible origin of the mutation in many families with an isolated patient, uncertainty remained for quite a number of their female relatives because of the possible occurrence of germline mosaicism. Forty-one women requested prenatal diagnosis during one or more pregnancies. The short time interval between pregnancies, even after abortion of an affected fetus, proved that first-trimester prenatal diagnosis has become an acceptable option for women at risk. Recently, efficient methods for direct identification of mutations have been developed, and they may allow a definite diagnosis for all families with hemophilia in the near future.
