An unusual case of trisomy and triploidy in a chorion villus biopsy.
A case is reported of a 35-year-old woman who underwent a chorion villus biopsy (CVB) at 17 weeks' gestation after intrauterine growth retardation and oligohydramnios were diagnosed by ultrasound scan. Chromosome analysis of the CVB direct preparations showed a 47,XX,+6 karyotype in all cells. The pregnancy was terminated and subsequent analysis of cultured cells from both the CVB and the post-mortem placenta showed three cell lines: 46,XX, 47,XX,+6 and 69,XXX, while fetal skin and muscle were entirely 69,XXX. An explanation is proposed for the origin and distribution of the three cell lines.
