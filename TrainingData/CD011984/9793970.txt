Comparison of urinary free beta (hCG) and beta-core (hCG) in prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities.
To evaluate the potential utility of free beta (hCG) and beta-core (hCG) in a prenatal screening protocol for Down syndrome we analysed these markers in dried maternal urine specimens from 163 control, 13 Down syndrome and 5 trisomy 18 pregnancies from 8 to 25 weeks' gestation. All results are reported after normalization for urinary creatinine determined by modified Jaffe reagent assay. The correlation of urinary free beta (hCG) and urinary beta-core (hCG) was 0.61 in controls and 0.93 in Down syndrome. Median MoM values in Down syndrome were 2.42 for urinary free beta (hCG) and 2.40 for beta-core (hCG). In trisomy 18 the Median MoM was 0.35 and 0.34 for free beta (hCG) and beta-core (hCG), respectively. The degree of elevation observed in DS cases with urinary free beta (hCG) is consistent with previous reports. Studies of beta-core (hCG) in Down syndrome have yielded discrepant results. In this study, beta-core (hCG) in Down syndrome is lower than values observed in early reports but consistent with more recent reports.
