Practice guidelines for communicating a prenatal or postnatal diagnosis of Down syndrome: recommendations of the national society of genetic counselors.
Down syndrome is one of the most common conditions encountered in the genetics clinic. Due to improvements in healthcare, educational opportunities, and community inclusion over the past 30 years, the life expectancy and quality of life for individuals with Down syndrome have significantly improved. As prenatal screening and diagnostic techniques have become more enhanced and widely available, genetic counselors can expect to frequently provide information and support following a new diagnosis of Down syndrome. This guideline was written for genetic counselors and other healthcare providers regarding the communication of a diagnosis of Down syndrome to ensure that families are consistently given up-to-date and balanced information about the condition, delivered in a supportive and respectful manner.
