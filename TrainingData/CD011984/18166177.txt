A live birth after transfer of a day 2 embryo derived from frozen-thawed zygotes that had undergone polar body biopsy: a case report.
OBJECTIVE: To present a live birth after freezing and thawing of biopsied oocytes. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Artificial reproduction unit of a university hospital. PATIENT(S): A primary infertile couple with asthenoteratozoospermia and repeated failures of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). INTERVENTION(S): Screening of aneuploidy during the fourth ICSI cycle with polar body biopsy (PB) for repeated failures of artificial reproductive techniques and a transfer of a cryopreserved day 2 embryo derived from cryopreserved zygotes with slow-rate freezing after PB. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE(S): Live birth, viability, and survival. RESULT(S): A successful pregnancy and a live birth were presented after a transfer of day 2 embryos derived from oocytes that underwent PB and subsequent cryopreservation. CONCLUSION(S): Pregnancy can be obtained subsequent to cryopreservation and thawing after PB.
