Cytogenetic diagnosis using midtrimester fetal blood samples: application to suspected mosaicism and other diagnostic problems.
Cytogenetic studies on fetal blood cells obtained at 18-25 weeks gestation have provided information for decision making in 25 cases identified as being at high risk of having an abnormal fetus. In particular, in the 21 cases studied to consider the possibility of true mosaicism, confirmation in fetal blood was obtained in three, one of which presented as a pseudomosaic on the original amniotic fluid cell study. Fetal blood was also informative in two cases (one positive and the other negative) in which a diagnosis of the fragile X syndrome was being considered. Furthermore, when high risk pregnancies presented late in gestation (21-24 weeks), these methods allowed for a rapid cytogenetic diagnosis. The procedure has proved useful in most of these cases since the couples involved had indicated that they would probably have terminated the pregnancy without the reassurance of normal fetal lymphocyte studies. Since the technique carries a much higher risk of pregnancy loss than does amniocentesis, its use should only be considered when there are compelling indications.
