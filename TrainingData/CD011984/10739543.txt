Highly abnormal maternal inhibin and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels along with severe HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome at 17 weeks' gestation with triploidy.
A 17-week pregnancy complicated by severe hypertension is reported. The fetus had multiple anomalies and was found to have triploidy.
