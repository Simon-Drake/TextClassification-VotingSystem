[The role of fetal echocardiography in the prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidy based upon prenatally diagnosed patau syndrome fetuses (case analysis)].
OBJECTIVE: Assessment of usefulness of the fetal echocardiography and genetic sonography in prenatal diagnosis trisomy 13 (retrospective analysis). MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between 1994-1999 at the Department for Diagnosis of Congenital Malformation at the Institute of PPMH in 11 fetuses with Patau Syndrome ultrasound and echocardiography examination were performed. In our study the most of cases come from low risk of pregnant women. RESULTS: Fetal heart defect was the most common anomaly diagnosed prenatally in fetuses with Patau Syndrome (7/11), the second one were central nervous system anomalies (6/11) and genitourinary system anomalies (6/11).
