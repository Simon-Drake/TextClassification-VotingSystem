[Warkany syndrome associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum].
Trisomy of chromosome 8 (Warkany syndrome) is a rare chromosomal abnormality associated with retarded psycho-motor development, facial dysmorphism and other structural anomalies. We present a case report of fetal mosaicism of trisomy 8 at 30 weeks of gestation associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum as part of a larger polymalformation sequence.
