The ultrasound markers of chromosomal disease: a retrospective study.
Over a 3 year period 37 pregnancies were complicated by a chromosomal abnormality. In the two cases of trisomy 13, holoprosencephaly, facial clefting, polydactyly and growth retardation were seen. In the seven cases of trisomy 18, abnormalities of the extremities, face and heart were common. Growth retardation and diaphragmatic hernia were also demonstrated. In the 21 cases of Down's syndrome the main abnormalities were cardiac, duodenal atresia and subtle digital anomalies. The two fetuses with triploidy showed a large hydropic placenta and holoprosencephaly respectively, and all five cases of Turner's syndrome demonstrated a cystic hygroma two of which were associated with hydrops. From the antenatal scans major anomalies were detected in 18 fetuses, however, chromosomal disease was suspected in only 15 cases. This was in part owing to a high false negative rate for cardiac anomalies (14 cases) in both routine and detailed scans. Owing to the diversity of anomalies present in chromosomal disease full assessment of the fetus is recommended with particular attention to the fetal heart, face, hands and feet. Specific anomalies are suggested for karyotype.
