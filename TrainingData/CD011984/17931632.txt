Selection of embryos by morphology is less effective than by a combination of aneuploidy testing and morphology observations.
There is a known correlation between morphology and euploidy, but we believe that the association between the two embryo selection systems is too marginal to claim that it is absolute and that one can simply replace one system by the other. The optimal way to select euploid embryos is through a combination of morphology determination and preimplantation genetic diagnosis.
