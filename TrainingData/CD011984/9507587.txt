Factors affecting women's knowledge of antenatal serum screening.
Antenatal screening for fetal anomaly is offered routinely in Glasgow. This study assessed pregnant women's knowledge of the test and implications of results. Questionnaires were completed by 574 women. Knowledge of the nature and uses of the test was superior to earlier studies Two-thirds knew that screening was undertaken for Down's syndrome, and 81% for spina bifida. The majority were aware of the sample used, ages invited and gestation at which it was undertaken. Knowledge of the likely results and implications was poorer. Three-quarters were unaware that 10% of results would suggest an increased risk. Half did not realise that positive results could occur without fetal abnormality, or negative results could be falsely reassuring. Socioeconomic deprivation was associated with poorer knowledge but not lower uptake. Written information was associated with superior knowledge and higher uptake. Leaflets should be provided prior to booking, at which time resultant queries can be answered.
