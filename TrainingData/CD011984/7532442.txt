Comparison of a time-resolved immunofluorimetric assay with two immunoenzymatic methods for alpha-foetoprotein in human serum.
We compared two commercial methods with a time-resolved immunofluorimetric assay for alpha-foetoprotein in human serum using the europium complex of 4,7-bis(chlorosulphophenyl)-1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxylic acid as label. The correlation coefficients were r1 = 0.94 and r2 = 0.96.
