Confirmation of true mosaic trisomy 20 in a phenotypically normal liveborn male.
A new case of prenatally detected mosaic trisomy 20 (79% trisomy 20 cells in amniocyte cultures) that was confirmed in newborn tissue is presented. A healthy male infant was delivered at term, with no dysmorphology or apparent malformations; this baby is developing normally. Twenty-five percent of foreskin and 17% of fetal cord cells also showed trisomy 20, while no trisomic cells were detected in newborn blood. High frequency mosaicism for trisomy 20 in this case was thus due to true embryonic origin. Extensive counseling and prenatal follow-up in this case led to an unaffected liveborn, and guarded optimism may be warranted for future cases of mosaic trisomy 20 detected prenatally.
