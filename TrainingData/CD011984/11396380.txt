Trisomy 13 in one fetus from a twin gestation after intracytoplasmic sperm injection. A case report.
BACKGROUND: Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is an assisted reproductive technique used in the treatment of severe male factor infertility. Reports of chromosomal aberrations in some fetuses conceived following ICSI have raised concern that the technique may contribute to the development of genetic disease. CASE: Trisomy 13 occurred in one of twin fetuses of a 28-year-old woman who underwent ICSI. This case is unique because it is the first reported one of an autosomal trisomy complicating one fetus from a twin gestation conceived by ICSI. It is also the first case describing an autosomal trisomy following ICSI in a woman under the age of 35. CONCLUSION: Chromosomal abnormalities associated with ICSI may be accounted for by factors other than advanced maternal age. Chromosomal aberrations may be related to the procedure itself. Therefore, patients should be advised of the possibility of aneuploidy in association with ICSI, and genetic amniocentesis should be considered regardless of maternal age.
