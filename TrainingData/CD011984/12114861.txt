[Early transvaginal measurement of cephalic index for the detection of fetuses at risk for Down syndrome].
BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of cephalic index screening in early pregnancy for the identification of fetuses at risk for trisomy 21. METHODS: Measurements of cephalic index, calculated as the ratio between biparietal diameter/occipito-frontal diameter, were obtained in 36 Down syndrome fetuses and the values were compared with normal data in the same gestational periods considered. RESULTS: Cephalic index was found to show fairly constant values throughout the period evaluated. The measurements obtained in Down syndrome fetuses were similar to those obtained in euploid fetuses. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained show that in early pregnancy cephalic index cannot be considered a useful tool in the detection of fetuses at risk for Down syndrome.
