[Prenatal cytogenetics. Indications--organization--problems].
Amniotic cell cultures, successfully introduced in 1966, are the tool to study the fetal karyotype most frequently because of maternal age risk for aneuploidies, particularly trisomy 21. The methodological problems of culturing (i.e. pseudomosaics, polymorphisms) are discussed with special regard to improvements and new techniques such as flow cytophotometry, culture of trophoblasts and fetal lymphocyte culture.
