Increased nuchal translucency as a marker for fetal chromosomal defects.
BACKGROUND: Screening for trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) by measuring maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, chorionic gonadotropin, and estriol concentrations and then performing chorionic-villus sampling or amniocentesis identifies approximately 60 percent of fetuses with this disorder. We used ultrasonography to detect increased nuchal translucency and cystic hygroma, which are characteristic features of fetuses with chromosomal defects. METHODS: We performed transvaginal ultrasonography in 10,010 unselected adolescents and women less than 40 years of age with live singleton fetuses at 10 to 15.9 weeks of gestation. Increased fetal nuchal translucency was defined as an area of translucency at least 3 mm in width, and cystic hygromas were defined as septated, fluid-filled sacs in the nuchal region. Subjects whose fetuses had these findings were offered fetal karyotyping. Information on pregnancies, deliveries, and neonates was subsequently obtained from hospital records and national birth and malformation registries. RESULTS: Nuchal translucency or cystic hygroma was seen in 76 fetuses (0.8 percent), of which 18 (24 percent) had an abnormal karyotype. The sensitivity for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 combined was 62 percent (13 of 21 fetuses), and the sensitivity for trisomy 21 alone was 54 percent (7 of 13 fetuses). CONCLUSIONS: The use of transvaginal ultrasonography to detect increased nuchal translucency and cystic hygroma is a sensitive test for fetal aneuploidy. It can be done earlier in pregnancy than serum screening, and it decreases the subsequent need for chorionic-villus sampling or amniocentesis.
