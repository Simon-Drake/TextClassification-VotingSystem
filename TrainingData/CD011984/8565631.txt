Case report: unusually high rates of aneuploid embryos in a 28-year old woman with incontinentia pigmenti.
A young female carrier for incontinentia pigmenti underwent preimplantation genetic diagnosis to prevent the transfer of affected embryos. FISH diagnosis was performed using X, Y, 18 and 13/21 probes. Unexpectedly, 57% of the embryos were aneuploid for these chromosomes, a rate significantly higher (P < 0.005) than expected (9.3%). The patient achieved pregnancy but spontaneously aborted a trisomy 9 fetus.
