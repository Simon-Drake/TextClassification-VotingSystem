Over a decade of experience with preimplantation genetic diagnosis.
The three respondents provide additional support for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) having the pivotal place it now has in prenatal genetic diagnosis: chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., unbalanced translocations), Mendelian disorders, and HLA typing for transfer of compatible, genetically normal, embryos. Transferring euploid embryos has decreased the clinical abortion rate and increased the implantation rate in assisted reproductive technologies (ART), but it has not necessarily improved the live-birth rate. Safer embryo biopsy, more extensive diagnostic efforts (i.e., microarray analysis), and more refined patient selection may be required before shifting from preselection of embryos based solely on morphological parameters to transfer of only aneuploidy-free embryos.
