Twin pregnancy: the role of ultrasound in management.
Determination of chorionicity is one of the most important issues in the management of twin pregnancy. Modern ultrasound equipment has made it possible to accurately assess placentation already in the first trimester with the lambda sign. With regard to prenatal diagnosis, it is important to know the chorionicity in order to calculate the risk of chromosomally abnormal fetuses. Accurate chorionicity offers the obstetricians the opportunity to observe the monochorionic twins more intensively than is required for twins with dichorionic placentation. This review gives an update of the state of the art for clinicians caring for twin pregnancies.
