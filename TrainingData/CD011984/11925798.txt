[Arguments for offering triple test serum screening for Down's syndrome to all pregnant women].
In an advisory report to the Dutch Government, the Health Council of the Netherlands has recently recommended offering triple test serum screening for Down's syndrome to all pregnant women. According to a critical review in this journal, the Council should have proposed excluding those less than 30 years of age. However, there is no age at which a logical limit can be set. Moreover, to suggest that the negative aspects of the screening will prevail for those under a specific age, denies the women involved the right to make a judgment based on their own values and preferences. Secondly, although limited resources may be a reason for limiting access to screening, doing so would be a politico-ethical decision, which raises the issue of justice. Finally, there are reasons for thinking that a new age limit would complicate the necessary counselling as opposed to making it easier.
