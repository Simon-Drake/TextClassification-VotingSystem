[Prenatal diagnosis and characteristics of chromosome aberrations in families with genetic risk].
Characteristics of the chromosomal aberrations diagnosed in 959 prenatal tests in the II trimester of pregnancy is presented. Chromosomal aberrations were diagnosed in 33 tests (3.4%). Twenty one out of these aberrations (2.2%) were of labile character. Six aberrations resulted from the parental segregation, translocation or chromosomal inversion. In 12 cases fetus inherited stable aberration from one of parents. It amounted to 1.2% of all tested cases. Chromosomal aberrations were diagnosed in 2.7% cases tested due to the risk related to the mother's age. Half of them was trisomy of chromosome 21. Chromosomal aneuploidy in the progeny of families with a child with the same abnormality was diagnosed in 1.6% of cases. Chromosomal mosaicism was diagnosed in 2.2% of cases including 0.2% of cases with true mosaicism and 1.98% of cases with pseudomosaicism. Incidence and type of the diagnosed chromosomal aberrations coincided with foreseen aberrations for each group of the genetic risk.
