Sex chromosome mosaicism in gonads of a fetus with cystic hygroma and deletion of the short arm of Y chromosome including loss of SRY.
The SRY gene on the short arm of the Y chromosome is necessary for male development. Without SRY, patients with 46,XY karyotype develop as females, fail to achieve normal puberty and have dysgenic gonads and a high incidence of gonadoblastoma. Here we report a female fetus, aborted at 17 weeks of pregnancy, with a non-mosaic 46,X,del(Y)(p11.2).ish del(Y)(SRY-) karyotype diagnosed by classical cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Ovarian tissue was full of oocytes and mitotic figures. FISH studies of ovarian tissues with X and Y centromere probes revealed extensive sex chromosome mosaicism, manifested by loss of the Y chromosome and polysomy of the X chromosome. We propose that X chromosome polysomy is a post-zygotic event that arises to facilitate gonadal differentiation in the absence of all factors necessary for normal gonadal development.
