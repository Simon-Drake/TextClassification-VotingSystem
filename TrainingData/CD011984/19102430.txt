[Termination of pregnancy after the 20-week ultrasonographic examination: haste and caution].
The recently introduced ultrasonographic screening programme for the detection of fetal structural anomalies at 20 weeks' gestation is leading to a growing number of cases with an unclear prognosis. This article presents the decision-making process which followed the screening of two women: one aged 36 years, where a post-screening work-up was conducted and swiftly led to well-balanced decision making to abort a fetus with trisomy 21, and one woman aged 30 years, in whom repeated non-decisive results of further diagnostic tests ultimately led to a hasty decision to abort the pregnancy. Up to 24 weeks, current Dutch law allows the couple to decide to have a termination of pregnancy; thereafter the legal possibility of having a termination is very limited. This may lead to rushed decision-making. It is argued that careful decisions in these matters are more important than staying within the 24-week limit. The national central committee ofexperts which is responsible for the evaluation of all abortions after 24 weeks gestation in the so-called category 2 cases (conditions which will lead to serious and irreparable functional disorders, such as severe spina bifida and hydrocephalus, but which are compatible with life) should take account of this dilemma ofhaste and caution.
