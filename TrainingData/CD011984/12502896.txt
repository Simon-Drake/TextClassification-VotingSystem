An examination of different fetal specific antibodies and magnetic activated cell sorting for the enrichment of fetal erythroblasts from maternal blood.
The aim of the present study was to compare the rates of fetal cells obtained after separation from maternal blood by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) using different fetal specific antibodies, and to evaluate the potential role of this method in the prenatal diagnosis of fetal trisomies. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 42 women carrying chromosomally normal fetuses and from 4 women with aneuploid fetuses (2 cases of 47,XX,+18 and 2 of 47,XY,+21) at 9-20 weeks of gestation. After fetal cells were enriched by MACS with three different monoclonal antibodies (GPA, CD71, CD14), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome X, and Y-specific probes was performed to detect the rates of fetal cells in the samples sorted. FISH with chromosome 13-, 18-, and 21-specific probes was carried out to compare proportions of cells with three-signal nuclei in chromosomally normal and abnormal groups. In male infants, X- and Y-positive cells were detected in 80%, 73.3%, and 66.6% of samples after the separation by antibodies CD14, GPA, and CD71, respectively. The percentage of nuclei with three signals was increased in pregnancies with trisomy, ranging between 2% and 5.18%. Pregnancies with normal fetuses showed 0 to 3.7% of nuclei with three signals. The data demonstrate that fetal cell detection varies depending on the antibodies used for cell sorting. This study provides further evidence on the feasibility of screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities by enriching maternal blood for fetal cells and using FISH.
