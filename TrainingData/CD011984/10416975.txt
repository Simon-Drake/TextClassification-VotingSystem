The prenatal diagnosis of Pierre-Robin sequence.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the spectrum of prenatal sonographic and chromosomal findings, associated anomalies and perinatal and neonatal outcomes in cases with Pierre-Robin sequence. All cases (20) with Pierre Robin sequence, who were born at China Medical College Hospital between 1990 and 1997, were included and analysed in this series. 12 pregnancies (60 per cent) were complicated by polyhydramnios and 9 (45 per cent) were combined with cleft palate. Four cases (20 per cent) with cardiac anomalies were also observed. Two fetuses (10 per cent) had abnormal karyotyping (one trisomy 21, one trisomy 18). All fetuses were delivered at or near term. Male deviation was observed in cases with isolated Pierre-Robin sequence or combined mild anomalies (male female ratio: 13:3). Two neonatal mortalities and three with mental retardation were observed. This investigation provides a basis for counselling patients with fetal micrognathia or neonatal Pierre-Robin sequence. The main prenatal sonographic findings of Pierre-Robin sequence are micrognathia, polyhydramnios and cleft palate. In cases of polyhydramnios, sonographic examination of the facial profile and palate are recommended. After the finding of polyhydramnios, micrognathia, and even cleft palate, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of neonatal Pierre-Robin sequence. Cardiac evaluation and karyotyping is also recommended.
