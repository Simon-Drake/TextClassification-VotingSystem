Diagnosis of fetal acrania during the first trimester nuchal translucency screening for Down syndrome.
OBJECTIVES: Prenatal screening during the first-trimester using fetal nuchal translucency (NT) measurement and maternal serum levels of free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) has become an established method for the detection of fetal Down syndrome. Increasing evidence has shown that some of the fetal structural abnormalities could be identified during NT scanning. Second trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) measurements and ultrasound scans have been widely used in clinical practice to identify fetal neural tube defects (NTDs). In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of early diagnosis of fetal acrania during NT scanning. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 5890 pregnancies that were delivered in our hospital between January 1, 1999 and January 31, 2001. Among them, 3600 pregnant women received NT-based Down syndrome screening at 10-13 weeks' gestation. Pregnancies with fetal NTDs were evaluated and their maternal serum levels of free beta-hCG and PAPP-A were compared with those of the normal control pregnancies. RESULTS: Seven of the 3600 pregnancies were identified with fetal acrania and all of them were detected during first-trimester NT scanning. Among the seven cases, five had measurements of maternal serum concentration free beta-hCG and PAPP-A concentration, yet there were not significant difference between the pregnancies with fetal acrania and those of the control pregnancies (PAPP-A, 1.13 vs. 0.96; free beta-hCG, 1.10 vs. 1.06; P>0.05). Two of the seven affected patients did not have maternal serum biochemical measurements due to the immediate termination of pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that pregnancies with fetal acrania could be easily identified at the time of NT scanning. Careful ultrasound inspection of fetal structure during NT measurements at 10-13 weeks of gestation provides an encouraging advantage for early diagnosis of fetal acrania.
