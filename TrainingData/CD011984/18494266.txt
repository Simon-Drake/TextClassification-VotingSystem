[Chromosomal aberrations as etiological factors of intrauterine growth retardation].
BACKGROUND/AIM: Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is a pathological condition of pregnancy characterised by birth weight below the 10th centile. A number of fetal, placental and maternal causes can lead to IUGR; although, in most cases no specific causes can be identified. The aim of this study was to determine the part of chromosomal abnormalities in IUGR etiology. METHODS: Fetal blood karyotype taken by cordocentesis from 168 fetuses with diagnosed IUGR was analyzed. RESULTS: Chromosomal rearrangements both numerical and structural were detected in 14 cases (12.2%). Two cases were triploid. Patau syndrome, Edwards syndrome and Down syndrome were found in two cases each. There was one case of trisomy 7 (47, XY, +7) and one case of trisomy 16 (47, XX, +16); one translocation, 46, XY, t (2; 14)(q23; q32) and a deletion 46, XYdel (12) (p12) as well as two cases of sex chromosomes abnormalities, 45, X (Turner syndrome) and 47, XYY. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a consistent number of symmetrical IUGR cases (about 12%) can be associated with chromosomal rearrangements. Chromosomal aberrations that cause IUGR are heterogeneous, aberration of autosomes, mostly autosomal trisomies, being the most common.
