[Evaluation of Down's syndrome screening methods using maternal serum biochemistry in the second trimester pregnancy].
OBJECTIVE: To provide basis for selecting the suitable method of Down's syndrome biochemical screening in the second trimester pregnancy. METHODS: A total of 30 547 singleton pregnancies between 14 and 20(+ 6) weeks of pregnancy were collected and analyzed for maternal serum alpha-fetoproteins (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin, free beta subunit (beta-HCG) with or without unconjugated estriol (uE3). The screening risks were calculated using the software Lifecycle. The detection rates and the cost of per Down's syndrome detected were calculated and compared. And four different methods were compared in a series of 64 serum samples from Down's syndrome pregnancies. RESULTS: (1) Among the 64 affected cases, the detection rate of Down's syndrome was improved no matter in the double test (DT) or in the triple test (TT) if software Lifecycle (LC) was used to evaluate risks. And it was not suitable to evaluate risks with software 2T-Risks in the triple tests. (2) In the cohort of 30 547 singleton pregnancies, the detection rate of Down's syndrome with project DT-LC, which was double test using AFP and free beta-HCG together with software Lifecycle, and project TT-LC, which was triple test using AFP, free beta-HCG and uE3 together with software Lifecycle, was 56.25% and 57.14%, respectively. The former project was better because it decreased the false positive rate at a lower running cost. CONCLUSION: The DT-LC is an effective screening strategy for second trimester detection of fetal Down's syndrome in mainland China.
