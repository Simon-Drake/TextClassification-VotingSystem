Isolated fetal intracardiac hyperechogenic focus associated with neonatal outcome and triple test results.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between isolated intracardiac hyperechogenic focus (IHF) in the mid trimester of pregnancy with neonatal outcomes and triple test results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included low-risk pregnant women who came for routine follow-up to our antenatal clinic between years 2000 and 2005. A detailed structural survey by ultrasound (USG) of the fetal heart was performed on each fetus in the mid-trimester of pregnancy. All patients had mid-trimester triple tests performed between the 16th and 18th weeks' of pregnancy. We recruited a total of 40 pregnancies that had fetal IHF in the level II USG examination and a control group of 100 healthy pregnant women those which were followed-up during the same period. Twenty-nine fetuses (72.5%) had left, 8 (20%) had right whereas 3 (7.5%) had bilateral ventricular IHF. We compared the perinatal and neonatal outcomes and triple test results of the fetuses that had right and left IHF, and the controls. RESULTS: Cytogenetic amniocentesis was performed to 6 (15%) women in the study and 5 (5%) in the control group and all were normal. During follow-up IHF spontaneously disappeared in 30 fetuses [right (n: 5), left (n: 23) or bilateral (n: 2)]. We did not observe any cardiac problem in the postnatal period in all newborns. Only one infant (2.5%) in the study group was admitted to neonatal intensive care unit because of prematurity. Median delivery weeks (P = 0.023), head circumference (P = 0.013), 5-min Apgar score (P = 0.021] and apnea (P = 0.042) were significantly higher in fetuses with right IHF. Compared to the controls, median delivery weeks (P = 0.038) was significantly higher in fetuses with right IHF, but head circumference (P = 0.004), 1-min (P = 0.003) and 5-min (P < 0.001) Apgar scores were lower in fetuses with left IHF. However no difference was observed in second-trimester serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and estriol (E(3)) levels, in the three groups. There was no correlation between serum HCG, AFP and E(3) levels and the presence of IHF. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated IHF in the fetal heart in the mid-trimester of pregnancy seems not associated with adverse neonatal outcome and does not correlate with triple test results.
