Trisomy 14 mosaicism leading to cytogenetic discrepancies in chorionic villi sampled at different times.
Short- and long-term cultures of chorionic villi obtained in the 11th week of pregnancy revealed trisomy 14. After induced abortion trisomy 14 mosaicism was established in fetal skin and umbilical cord tissue while a second long-term culture of chorionic villi exhibited a normal karyotype. The results of the pathological investigations are discussed with respect to the cytogenetic findings.
