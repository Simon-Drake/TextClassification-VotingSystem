Adiponectin and insulin resistance in early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the importance of adiponectin and insulin resistance in early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia. DESIGN: A nested case-control study in 72 pregnant women who participated in the first-trimester Down-syndrome-screening programme and who delivered at our hospital. SETTING: University Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. POPULATION: Pregnant women: 36 women with pre-eclampsia of which 20 late onset and 16 early onset were compared with 36 uncomplicated pregnancies who delivered at term. METHODS: In all the women, insulin resistance was calculated by the homeostasis model assessment ratio (HOMA-IR) and plasma adiponectin was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Insulin resistance and adiponectin concentration. RESULTS: First-trimester plasma adiponectin mean levels in the whole pre-eclampsia group were significantly lower than that in the control group (8.4 +/- 3.3 versus 14.8 +/- 4.6 microgram/ml; P < 0.001), whereas first-trimester mean HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in the pre-eclampsia group than that in the control group (2.0 +/- 1.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.4; P= 0.01). Plasma adiponectin concentrations at delivery in the pre-eclampsia group were significantly higher than that in the control group (9.2 +/- 3.7 versus 7.8 +/- 2.6 microgram/ml; P= 0.04). First-trimester plasma adiponectin mean concentrations in the late-onset subgroup were significantly lower compared with the concentrations in early-onset subgroup (6.2 +/- 1.4 microgram/ml versus 11.1 +/- 3.2 microgram/ml; P < 0.001), and there was a significant difference in adiponectin plasma values only between women in the late-onset pre-eclampsia group versus those in the control group (P < 0.001). First-trimester mean HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in the late-onset subgroup compared with that of the early-onset subgroup (2.5 +/- 1.3 versus 1.3 +/- 0.3; P= 0.02), and there was a significant difference only between the control group versus the late-onset subgroup (P= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: First-trimester adiponectin and HOMA-IR values seem to select two completely different populations: early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia, which might suggest a different pathogenesis.
