Difficult diagnosis and management of an heterokaryotypic monochorionic twin pregnancy with discordant fetal sex and 45,X/47,XYY karyotypes.
We report twins for whom ultrasound examinations revealed a Turner syndrome in the female fetus and a normal male fetus. A selective pregnancy termination was decided on the female fetus with hydrops. The death of both twins called in question the chorionic diagnosis. Amniotic fluid cytogenetic analysis revealed a 45,X karyotype in the female twin and a 47,XYY karyotype in the male twin. Molecular cytogenetic analysis on genital and renal cells showed different levels of 45,X/47,XYY mosaicism in both twins; molecular analysis on the amniocytes showed monozygosity. Monozygotic twins with discordant sex are very rare. This study showed the difficult diagnosis and management of a monochorionic twin pregnancy with discordant fetal sex.
