Ultrasonographic measurements of fetal ear.
OBJECTIVE: To establish nomograms of fetal ear measurements. Newborns with trisomies have smaller ears than the normal population. This observation led us to believe that ear measurements might be useful in the antenatal prediction of fetuses with abnormal karyotypes. METHODS: Fetal ear length and width were obtained ultrasonographically in 124 normal singleton pregnancies between 18-42 weeks' gestation. Regression analyses were used to create the nomograms. RESULTS: Linear relationships were found between ear length and width and gestational age (r = 0.956 and 0.898, respectively). In addition, there were significant correlations between ear measurements and biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length. The ear width-length ratio and the biparietal diameter-ear length ratio were independent of gestational age. CONCLUSION: These normative data may be helpful in the antenatal prediction of chromosomal abnormalities.
