Cholelithiasis in infants with Down syndrome. Three cases and literature review.
Only four cases of cholelithiasis have been reported in patients with Down syndrome and none in Down syndrome infants. The cases of three Down syndrome infants (all males) with cholelithiasis are reported. Each exhibited different fetal complications, and in each, Down syndrome was diagnosed at birth. Gallstones apparently were congenital (a rarity) in one infant, since they were detected on the first day of life. Cholelithiasis was an incidental finding in another of the infants when, at 12 weeks old, he had renal ultrasonography because of a urinary tract infection. The third infant was 4 months old when sonographic studies revealed a gallstone. Despite the confirmation of cholelithiasis in all three infants, none has since had any signs or symptoms that suggest the need for intervention. Cholelithiasis is probably more common in Down syndrome infants than has been supposed, but whether Down syndrome infants with gastrointestinal (GI) malformations are more likely to have gallstones than are children with similar GI malformations but with normal karyotypes is unknown.
