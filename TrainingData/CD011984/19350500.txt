[Prenatal genetic study of fetuses with congenital heart diseases].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic abnormalities of fetuses with congenital heart diseases (CHD), and to provide guidance for the management of pregnancy and genetic counseling. METHODS: Eighty-one fetuses with CHD detected by fetal echocardiography were analyzed by karyotyping after amniocentesis, cordocentesis or chorionic sampling. Then 22q11.2 deletion/duplication was detected by a competitive fluorescent multiplex short tandem repeat assay in 47 CHD fetuses without chromosomal abnormalities. With fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using LSI dual color DNA probe, the deletion/duplication status was confirmed. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 81 CHD fetuses had chromosomal anomalies, and 1 of the 47 CHD fetuses without chromosomal anomalies had duplication at chromosome 22q11. The incidence of aneuploidy associated CHD was 43.2%. The rate of chromosomal anomalies is higher in the cases associated with extra-cardiac anomalies than in that with isolated CHD (64.5% versus 28.0%). In the 35 fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities, 19 (54.3%) were trisomy 18. CONCLUSION: Chromosomal abnormalities occurred in 43.2% of CHD cases and trisomy 18 is the most common aneuploidy. The likelihood of chromosomal anomaly increases when there is extracardiac involvement. Testing for the 22q11.2 microdeletion/duplication is recommended in all CHD fetuses without chromosomal anomalies. It is important for the further management of pregnancy and genetic counseling.
