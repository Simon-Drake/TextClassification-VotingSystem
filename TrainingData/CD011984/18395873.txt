Maternal serum ADAM12s in the late first trimester of pregnancies with Trisomy 21.
BACKGROUND: ADAM12s is a placenta-derived glycoprotein that is involved in growth and differentiation, and has been shown to be a potential first-trimester and second-trimester marker of Trisomy 21 and other aneuploides. Maternal ADAM12s concentrations show a considerable temporal variation with gestational age and here we study the levels at 11-13 weeks of gestation to establish the effectiveness or otherwise at a time when other established markers are used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples collected as part of routine first-trimester screening were retrieved from storage. In total, 46 samples from pregnancies with Trisomy 21 were identified and collected between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation-of these 83% had been identified by combined first-trimester screening. A series of 414 gestational age-matched samples collected during the same period formed the control group. ADAM12s was measured by a new DELFIA assay incorporating two monoclonals (6E6 and 8F8). Results were expressed as weight-corrected multiples of the median (MoM). RESULTS: The median MoM ADAM12s rose from 0.914 at 11 weeks to 1.032 at 13 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Combining the data from this study and other published studies suggests that ADAM12s is unlikely to be of much additional value when screening for Trisomy 21 in the period 11-13 weeks. More studies are required looking at the potential of ADAM12s prior to 10 weeks.
