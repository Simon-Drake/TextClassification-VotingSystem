Diagnostic applications of H-Y serology: H-Y negative phenotype in cells from 45,X/46,XY fetus with testes.
Sexual dysmorphism should be considered likely in cases in which H-Y- phenotype and XY complement are found together. In the case described here, a pregnancy was terminated at nineteen weeks of gestation after 45,X and 46,XY cell lines were detected among cultured amniocytes. The fetus was a male with hypospadias and intraabdominal testes containing irregular tubules and hyperplastic interstitium. Cultured skin fibroblasts, containing 45,X and 46,XY lines in ratio of 18:2, were typed H-Y antigen negative. This underscores the danger of predicting gonadal type on the basis of somatic H-Y phenotype.
