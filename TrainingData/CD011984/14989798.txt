Assessment of DNA fragmentation and aneuploidy on poor quality human embryos.
In human assisted reproduction, low embryo quality due to retarded growth and abnormal cellular morphology results in fewer embryos suitable for transfer. This study aimed to assess the extent of DNA fragmentation and aneuploidy in spare slow growing or arrested human embryos. In 19 assisted reproduction cycles, a total of 57 embryos unsuitable for embryo transfer were used for simultaneous apoptosis and aneuploidy assessment. Among them, 31 (54.3%) showed DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) analysis. Among 26 embryos that were negative for TUNEL, interpretable fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) results were obtained for 25 embryos (96.2%). Sixteen embryos were detected to be chromosomally abnormal (64.0%); three were found to be chaotic, six had complex aneuploidy, six had complete monosomy and one was polyploid. The results show that a high level of DNA fragmentation and aneuploidy are common in embryos with slow growth and/or low quality. More detailed studies are needed to assess the effect of factors such as ovarian stimulation regimens and in-vitro culture conditions. Moreover, application of simultaneous TUNEL and FISH techniques can be informative regarding DNA integrity and aneuploidy.
