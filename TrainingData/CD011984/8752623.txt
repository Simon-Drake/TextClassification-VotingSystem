Birth of healthy children after preimplantation diagnosis of common aneuploidies by polar body fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Preimplantation Genetics Group.
OBJECTIVE: To perform preimplantation diagnosis of common aneuploidies by polar body analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization technique using probes specific for chromosomes X, 18, and 13/21. DESIGN: The first and/or second polar bodies were removed and studied by fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect and avoid fertilization and transfer of oocytes with common aneuploidies. SETTING: The Reproductive Genetics Institute's IVF program at Illinois Masonic Medical Center. PATIENTS: One hundred ninety-three couples of advanced maternal age (34 to 46 years) under-going IVF treatment volunteered to be part of a clinical trial on preimplantation polar body diagnosis of common aneuploidies. INTERVENTIONS: Using micromanipulation procedures, the first and second polar bodies were removed after their extrusion from the oocytes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Fluorescent in situ hybridization signals specific for chromosomes X, 18, and 13/21. RESULTS: In 235 IVF cycles performed in 193 couples, 1,293 oocytes were biopsied and subjected to fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis, with fluorescent in situ hybridization results available in 993 oocytes (76.8%). Of 993 oocytes with fluorescent in situ hybridization results, 665 (67%) were predicted to be normal based on the chromosomes studied; 460 embryos resulting from these oocytes were transferred in 187 treatment cycles, resulting in 12 births of healthy children and 18 ongoing pregnancies after confirmation of the polar body diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. CONCLUSION: Polar body fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis may be used for preimplantation diagnosis of common aneuploidies in IVF patients of advanced maternal age.
