Prevalence and significance of isolated fetal choroid plexus cysts detected in early pregnancy by transvaginal sonography in women of advanced maternal age.
This study examines the prevalence of isolated fetal choroid plexus cysts (CPCs) detected in early pregnancy by transvaginal sonography in an increased genetic risk population and their association with abnormal fetal karyotype. A prospective study was performed on 1692 pregnant women (>37 years) who underwent transvaginal scan at 11-16 weeks' gestation before genetic amniocentesis. The prevalence of isolated CPCs in our population was 1.48 per cent. An abnormal fetal karyotype was found in one case (4 per cent). It was concluded that if fetal CPCs are apparently isolated, genetic amniocentesis is not mandatory and additional risk factors such as advanced maternal age should be the main indication for fetal karyotyping.
