Heat resistance, immunological and quantitative changes of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase in trisomy 21 pregnancies.
Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) was analysed in 25 pregnant women with trisomy 21 foetuses whose chromosomal aberration was recognized by cytogenetic study after amniocentesis. Enzyme investigation was performed at 20-22 weeks of gestation using cytochemical and biochemical techniques. Twenty-nine women at the same stage of normal pregnancies were selected as controls. In parallel, each mother was karyotyped. Ten subjects from each series underwent biochemical and immunological investigation: measurement of enzyme levels, thermostability study and immunological tests with alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme antibodies. NAP from pregnant women with trisomy 21 foetuses was characterized by: (1) a lower rate of enzyme activity, (2) a large amount of heat-stable enzyme (T = 56 degrees C for biochemical assays, T = 85 degrees C for cytochemical tests), and (3) a marked loss of liver antigenicity. These findings suggest the presence in trisomy 21 pregnancies of a non-specific alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme which appears as an "enzyme marker" in maternal circulating neutrophils.
