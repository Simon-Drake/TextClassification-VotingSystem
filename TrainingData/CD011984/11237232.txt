Fetal gastrointestinal malformations.
In an audit to evaluate fetal gastrointestinal (GIT) malformations, case sheets of all mothers who gave birth to newborns with GIT malformations were analysed regarding the maternal history, prenatal ultrasound and the postnatal structural malformations and perinatal management. In 1999, eleven babies were born with gastrointestinal malformations, one was a still birth. Nine had associated malformations of other systems, two had trisomy 21. Eight babies were operated in the immediate newborn period, 5 survived. Ultrasound was not very accurate in the diagnosis of GIT anomaly in this series. In view of associated chromosomal and structural anomaly a fetal ECHO and genetic amniocentesis is warranted. Most of these babies require immediate surgery after birth, so they need to be delivered in a centre which is equipped with good neonatal and pediatric surgery care.
