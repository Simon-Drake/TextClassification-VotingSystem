Mosaic and complete tetraploidy in live-born infants: two new patients and review of the literature.
Tetraploidy is a very rare finding in live-born infants. Nine infants with tetraploidy have been reported earlier. The phenotype is of variable severity and consists of prenatal and/or postnatal growth retardation, developmental delay, mental retardation, dysmorphic features, and skeletal and internal abnormalities. Here we present a girl aged 2 years and 7 months with a mosaic tetraploidy detected in lymphocytes, and a newborn boy with a complete tetraploidy, who died 30 h after birth. They both show growth retardation, microcephaly, developmental delay, and craniofacial dysmorphisms. The clinical features of 22 patients reported earlier are reviewed.
