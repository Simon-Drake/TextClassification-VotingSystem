Second trimester maternal serum beta human chorionic gonadotrophin and pregnancy outcome.
The aim of this prospective, controlled study was to examine the relation between second trimester maternal serum beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and birthweight. The study population consisted of 192 women with maternal serum betaHCG > or = 3.5 multiple of the median and a control group with the same number of women with maternal serum betaHCG < or = 2.0 multiple of the median. There was no difference in birthweight and other pregnancy outcomes between the two groups. When used prospectively, elevated betaHCG in the mid-trimester is not a predictor for intrauterine growth restriction or other pregnancy complications.
