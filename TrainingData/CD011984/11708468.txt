Both maternal and fetal cell-free DNA in plasma fluctuate.
Elevations in the concentration of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma have recently been determined in various pregnancy-related disorders, including preeclampsia, preterm labor, and polyhydramnios. In addition, almost 2-fold increments in cell-free fetal DNA levels have been recorded in pregnancies with certain aneuploid fetuses, in particular trisomy 21. These findings have led to the speculation that quantitative assessment of circulatory fetal DNA may be useful in the noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of certain fetal genetic constellations or pregnancy-related disorders. A premise for any quantitative analysis is that the quantity of the analyte being assayed does not vary greatly over time. As this aspect has not been examined for circulatory DNA levels, we examined these in normal healthy individuals as well as in pregnant women. Our data indicate that severalfold alterations in circulatory DNA amounts do occur over short periods of time. Of particular note is that we observed almost 2-fold variations in free fetal DNA levels over a period of 3 days, which are in a similar range to the elevations noted in aneuploid pregnancies. Our results, therefore, imply that caution should be used when using small increments in circulatory fetal DNA concentrations for potential diagnostic applications.
