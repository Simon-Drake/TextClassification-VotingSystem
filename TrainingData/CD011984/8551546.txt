Ease and accuracy of evaluation of fetal hands during obstetrical ultrasonography: a prospective study.
Hand malformations characterize many congenital syndromes, including mendelian disorders, skeletal dysplasias, and karyotype abnormalities. Although identification of a hand anomaly alters obstetrical management, evaluation of the fetal hands is not included in current ultrasonographic guidelines. We prospectively studied the utility of allotting up to 5 min to examine fetal hands during obstetrical ultrasonography. Both hands were visualized in 87% of patients (188 of 215). Eight hand abnormalities were present at delivery. Six had been identified antenatally, four during the study with ultrasonography. There were no false positives. Four fetuses with hand malformations were aneuploid. Fetal hands should be examined during a comprehensive obstetrical sonographic evaluation, especially when risk factors for aneuploidy are present.
