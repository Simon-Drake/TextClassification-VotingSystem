[Role of a mini-invasive approach in the diagnosis and treatment of tubo-peritoneal infertility as an altenative to IVF].
AIM: Tubal factor infertility accounts for approximately 25-35% of cases of female infertility. Identifiable causes of tubal infertility are postinfectious tubal damage, postsurgical adhesion formation, and endometriosis-related adhesions. Aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a diagnostic/therapeutic minimally invasive approach in patients with suspect or ascertained mechanical infertility in terms of obtained pregnancies. METHODS: The study enrolled 143 patients who underwent diagnostic or operative laparoscopy, with chromopertubation, peritoneal or endometrial culture, salpingoscopy when indicated and diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy. Nine patients with submucous-intramural or multiple intramural fibroids underwent miomectomy by minilaparotomy following hysteroscopy and chromopertubation. Patients were contacted periodically by telephone to monitor the onset and outcome of pregnancy. The mean length of follow- up was 49 months (range: 11 to 118 months). RESULTS: Of the 152 patients considered in the study, 61 became pregnant (40%). Twenty-three pregnancies resulted in miscarriage, two in tubal pregnancy and one patient aborted after a diagnosis of Down syndrome. In total, 32% of the patients achieved a term pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic/therapeutic mini-invasive approach allows women to become pregnant naturally and it is, therefore, an option for couples with ethical and religious concerns. The percentage of pregnancies is higher than after in-vitro fertilization. When efficacious, this approach allows additional spontaneous conceptions without renewed therapy and the course of pregnancy and the type of delivery will not differ from those in a normal population.
