Interphase M-FISH applications using commercial probes in prenatal and PGD diagnostics.
Early, rapid and reliable diagnosis is of first priority in prenatal medicine. The combination of specific sonographic markers (e.g. nuchal translucency) and biochemical parameters in maternal serum (e.g. free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A), has already dramatically improved the sensitivity of non-invasive first trimester risk screening in pregnancy. In invasive prenatal diagnosis, in addition to well-established chorionic villi short-term culture, interphase multi-colour-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (M-FISH) on uncultured amnion cells has become a reliable tool for the rapid detection of fetal aneuploidies. Interphase M-FISH applications have enabled the diagnosis of selected chromosomal abnormalities in single cells and, therefore, have also become an important diagnostic tool for preimplantation diagnosis (PGD). The development of commercially available probe sets, in particular, has led to a broad use of interphase M-FISH in prenatal and PGD diagnosis.
