Preimplantation genetic testing: indications and controversies.
In the last two decades, the use of preimplantation genetic testing has increased dramatically. This testing is used for identifying singlegene disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial disorders, gender selection in non-mendelian disorders with unequal gender distribution, aneuploidy screening, and other preconceptually identified genetic abnormalities in prospective parents. Genetic testing strategies and diagnostic accuracy continues to improve, but not without risks or controversies. In this review the authors discuss the techniques and clinical application of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and the debate surrounding its associated uncertainty and expanded use.
