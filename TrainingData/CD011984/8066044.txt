Maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin levels in twin pregnancies: implications for screening for Down's syndrome.
Free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin values are, on average, 1.90 times greater in twin pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies [95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 1.69-2.13]. This information can be used in screening for Down's syndrome, so that twin pregnancies can be interpreted in addition to singleton pregnancies.
