Quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction to detect chromosomal anomalies in spontaneous abortion.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the value of short tandem repeats (microsatellites) in the study of numerical chromosomal anomalies in spontaneous abortion. METHOD: Multiplex quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) was carried out on 61 spontaneous abortion samples and 48 controls using microsatellite markers from 8 chromosomes where aneuploids are commonly found. RESULTS: Of the 61 samples, 65.6% were successfully karyotyped, and the call rate of the QF-PCR was 98.3%. The correspondence between PCR and karyotyping was 95%. The success rate of karyotyping in the inevitable abortion group was 79.6%, higher than for the missed abortion group (8.3%), P<0.001. The call rate of QF-PCR showed no difference between these 2 groups (100% vs 91.7%, P=0.197). CONCLUSION: Microsatellite-based QF-PCR is a helpful and reliable tool to diagnose numerical chromosomal anomalies in spontaneous abortion. It also provides a diagnosis for necrotic tissue.
