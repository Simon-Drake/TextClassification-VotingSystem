Monosomy 10qter due to a balanced maternal translocation: t(10;8)(q23;p23).
A new case of partial monosomy 10q is described. The clinical symptoms are similar to the previous cases reported, although the segment lost is larger (q23-qter). The mother was a balanced carrier of 46,XX,t(10;8)(q23;p23). Amniocentesis was carried out since the mother was again pregnant and the result was a female fetus 46,XX,t(10;8)(q23;p23).
