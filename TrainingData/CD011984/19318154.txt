Comparison of modes of ascertainment for mosaic vs complete trisomy 21.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the indications for amniocentesis leading to the detection of either mosaicism of trisomy 21 (mosaic-T21) or complete trisomy 21 (T21). STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of a large amniocentesis database (n = 494,163) was conducted. All specimens with mosaic-T21 (n = 124) were compared with a maternal age-matched group of T21 fetuses (n = 496). Samples with normal karyotypes were matched for maternal age and served as normal controls (n = 496). The chi(2) testing was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The presence of an abnormal first-trimester screen, abnormal sonographic findings, and specifically the single sonographic abnormalities of either a cystic hygroma or a cardiac anomaly were significantly less common in the mosaic-T21 as compared with the T21 group. There were no such differences between the mosaic-T21 and the normal control group. CONCLUSION: Fetuses with mosaic-T21, similar to those with normal karyotype, do not present with the same abnormal screening tests as fetuses with T21.
