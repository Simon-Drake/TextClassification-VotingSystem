Chromosomal mosaicism confined to the placenta in human conceptions.
Placental and fetal tissues from 46 human pregnancies were cultured and cytogenetically analyzed in an attempt to document the existence of chromosomal mosaicism confined strictly to tissues of extraembryonic origin. In two gestations in which chromosomal mosaicism was found, it was expressed exclusively in placental chorionic cells and was not detected in cells derived from the embryo proper. This demonstration of confined chorionic mosaicism may have implications for the understanding of the fetoplacental unit and for prenatal diagnosis.
