[Screening for Down syndrome using first-trimester combined screening followed by second trimester ultrasound examination in an unselected population].
BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported the efficacy of first trimester combined screening for Down Syndrome based on maternal age, serum markers (human chorionic gonadotropin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A), and ultrasound measurement of fetal nuchal translucency. However, those do not incorporate the value of the widely accepted routine 20-22 week anomaly scan. STUDY DESIGN: We carried out a multi-centre, interventional study in the unselected population of a single health authority in order to assess the performance of first trimester combined screening, followed by routine second trimester ultrasound examination and/or screening by maternal serum markers (free beta-hCG and alpha-fetoprotein measurement or total hCG, alpha-fetoprotein and unconjugated estriol measurement) when incidentally performed. Detection and screen positive rates were estimated using a correction method for non verified issues. A cost analysis was also performed. RESULTS: During the study period, 14,934 women were included. Fifty-one cases of Down Syndrome were observed, giving a prevalence of 3.4 per 1000 pregnancies. Of these, 46 were diagnosed through first (N=41) or second (N=5) trimester screening. Among the 5 screen-negative Down syndrome cases, all were diagnosed postnatally after an uneventful pregnancy. Detection and screen positive rates of first trimester combined screening were 79.6% and 2.7%, respectively. These features reached 89.7 and 4.2%, respectively when combined with second trimester ultrasound screening. The average cost of the full screening procedure was 108 euro (120 $) per woman and the cost per diagnosed Down syndrome pregnancy was 7,118 euro (7,909 $). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that one pragmatic interventional two-step approach using first-trimester combined screening followed by second trimester detailed ultrasound examination is a suitable and acceptable option for Down syndrome screening in pregnancy.
