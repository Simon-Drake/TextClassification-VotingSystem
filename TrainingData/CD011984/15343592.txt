Doppler assessment of cardiac function at 11-14 weeks' gestation in fetuses with normal and increased nuchal translucency.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate cardiac dysfunction as a potential underlying mechanism for increased nuchal translucency (NT) in fetuses with chromosomal abnormality or heart defects. METHODS: Myocardial performance index (MPI) and atrioventricular valve E/A ratios for both sides of the heart were measured by Doppler echocardiography in fetuses at 11-14 weeks' gestation. The study groups consisted of 159 normal control fetuses, 199 otherwise normal fetuses but with increased NT > or = 4 mm, 142 fetuses with trisomy 21, 58 with trisomy 18, 19 with trisomy 13, 37 with Turner's syndrome and 24 with isolated heart defects. Groups were compared using Student's t-test and confidence intervals for differences between groups were calculated. RESULTS: Otherwise normal fetuses with increased NT showed no difference in any of the cardiac Doppler parameters from normal controls. Mean E/A ratio was slightly but significantly increased in trisomy 21 fetuses compared with normal controls (0.604 vs. 0.578 on the right, P = 0.011; 0.581 vs. 0.542 on the left, P = 0.0001). E/A ratio was not significantly different between any of the other groups and the normals but there was a small increase in absolute E-wave velocity in trisomy 18 fetuses. MPI was significantly decreased in trisomy 21 fetuses, (0.330 vs. 0.378, P = 0.002 on the left) and also in Turner's syndrome fetuses (0.301 vs. 0.352 on the right, P = 0.04; 0.320 vs. 0.378 on the left, P = 0.034) implying better performance, but not in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude and/or direction of the differences shown do not support a major role for cardiac functional abnormality in the development of NT. Important cardiac dysfunction could not be demonstrated in association with increased NT in normal or abnormal fetuses.
