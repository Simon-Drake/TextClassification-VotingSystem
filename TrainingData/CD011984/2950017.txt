[Fetal neck edema--early sonographic indications of a chromosome abnormality].
Fetal nuchal edema is described as an early sonographic sign of a chromosomal anomaly. Eight cases of fetal nuchal edema were detected by sonography, and for this reason the fetal karyotypes were established by means of rapid karyotyping. Trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) and the 45,XO constellation (Turner's syndrome) were most commonly found. In one case with trisomy 21, only a temporary occurrence of fetal nuchal edema could be identified. The pathogenesis of fetal edemas is discussed. If the likelihood of pathologic conditions can be ruled out by sonography, differentiated counseling for antenatal diagnosis is possible.
