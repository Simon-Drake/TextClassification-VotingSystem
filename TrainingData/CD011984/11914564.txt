Second-trimester maternal pregnancy-associated plasma protein a and inhibin a levels in fetal trisomies.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether fetal trisomy is associated with altered levels of second-trimester maternal pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and inhibin A. METHODS: Maternal serum PAPP-A and inhibin A concentrations were measured at 15-17 weeks of gestation in 14 singleton pregnancies with fetal trisomy and in 56 matched pregnant controls. RESULTS: PAPP-A levels in the trisomy group were significantly lower than in controls. The inhibin A level with fetal trisomy 21 was slightly higher than the control group, but levels were not different between trisomies 18 and 13 and controls. CONCLUSION: Fetal trisomies 21, 18, and 13 are associated with a reduction in second-trimester maternal PAPP-A levels; trisomies 18 and 13 are not associated with increased inhibin A levels, unlike trisomy 21.
