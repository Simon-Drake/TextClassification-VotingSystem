A marker X chromosome associated with nonspecific male mental retardation. The first South African cases.
This report describes the first cases of X-linked mental retardation with a marker X chromosome seen in South Africa, and forms part of an ongoing study. The marker was found in 11 affected males and 1 carrier female in 4 families investigated. The demonstration of the marker X chromosome characterized by a fragile site at the long arm (fra(X) (q27) in association with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation heralds a new era in cytogenetics. The attention of human geneticists everywhere is focused on various aspects of this fascinating phenomenon. It has now become possible to diagnose an apparently common familial cytogenetic condition with a high risk of recurrence and to identify female carriers; perhaps in time we will be able to provide prenatal diagnosis. Because of the familial involvement through X-linked inheritance the syndrome is believed to be more common than trisomy 21. The nature of the association of mental retardation with the marker X chromosome is unknown, but it could be related to close linkage with abnormal gene(s) or due to faulty transcription of the genes beyond the fragile site.
