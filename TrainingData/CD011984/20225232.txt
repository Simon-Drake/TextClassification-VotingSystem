First-trimester serum marker distribution in singleton pregnancies conceived with assisted reproduction.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate marker distribution of free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (fbeta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) in singleton pregnancies conceived by assisted reproduction techniques (ART). METHODS: In vitro fertilization (IVF) (n = 203) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (n = 192) cases from a database of 14 645 first-trimester combined tests (overall study group) were selected and matched to 1164 controls for gestational age at sample date and maternal age. RESULTS: In the IVF group and ICSI group, lnPAPP-A was lower (IVF 6.74 vs 7.08; P = 0.0001; ICSI 6.59 vs 7.07; P = 0.0001) compared with the matched controls. Lnfbeta-hCG was lower in the IVF group (3.75 vs 3.90; P = 0.005) but not significantly different in the ICSI group (3.87 vs 3.93; P = 0.27). The computed correction factors for PAPP-A and fbeta-hCG were 1.42 and 1.17 for the IVF group and 1.56 and 1.05 for the ICSI group.The false-positive rate (FPR) in the IVF and ICSI group compared with the matched controls was higher (IVF 10.3% vs 8.6% and ICSI 10.9% vs 7.5%). In the overall age-biased [maternal age significantly lower compared with all ART and control groups] study group the FPR was 6.8%. CONCLUSION: The increase in FPR in the ART groups can be explained by decreased PAPP-A values. Therefore, an adjustment in risk analysis for Down syndrome is suggested.
