Sensitivity of chromosomal mosaicism detection by different tissue culture methods.
In the field of prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis, two tissue culture methodologies are currently in use: the flask method, which examines mixed populations of cells, and the in situ method, which examines distinct colonies of cells. These two methods provide inherently different levels of sensitivity which can be made comparable by adjusting the number of cells examined depending on the methodology used and the number of colonies formed per ml of specimen. Assuming that there are 2 colonies per ml of amniotic fluid in a 20 ml specimen, in order to detect 10, 20, and 30 per cent mosaicism with 95 per cent confidence, 29, 14, and 9 colonies should be examined respectively by the in situ method. Similarly, 50, 17, and 10 cells must be analysed by the flask method.
