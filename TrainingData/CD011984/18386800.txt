Sotos syndrome: antenatal presentation.
There is little published information regarding the clinical presentation of Sotos syndrome in pregnancy. In this report, we describe the antenatal presentation of a child subsequently diagnosed with Sotos syndrome by molecular analysis. The pregnancy was complicated by a positive maternal serum screen and abnormal ultrasound findings including macrocephaly, polyhydramnios and decreased fetal movements. This is the first report of an elevated Down syndrome risk in a pregnancy with confirmed Sotos syndrome. Sotos syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of newborns with a normal karyotype where the pregnancy has demonstrated an increased risk for Down syndrome by maternal serum screening, especially in the presence of supportive ultrasound findings.
