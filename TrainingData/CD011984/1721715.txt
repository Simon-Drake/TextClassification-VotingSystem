First-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and chorionic gonadotropin in aneuploid pregnancies.
First-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels were measured in samples from 29 women with cytogenetically abnormal pregnancies and 145 women with cytogenetically normal pregnancies matched for gestational age, race, and sample storage time. All patients had a risk of fetal aneuploidy greater than or equal to that of a mother 35 years of age. AFP was significantly lower in samples from pregnancies affected with trisomy 21 (0.67 MoM; p less than 0.05), while HCG values were no different from those of matched controls. Trisomies 13 and 18 could not be distinguished from matched controls by AFP. However, levels of HCG were significantly lower in such pregnancy samples, with median values of 0.65 MoM in trisomy 13 and 0.32 MoM in trisomy 18 (p less than 0.05). Variations in AFP and HCG levels suggest that expressed differences between autosomal aneuploidies include differences in fetal and placental protein production in the first trimester.
