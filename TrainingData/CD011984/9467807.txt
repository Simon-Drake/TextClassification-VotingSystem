Screening for Down syndrome using urine hCG free beta-subunit in the second trimester of pregnancy.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) free beta-subunit levels were determined in 709 control and 13 Down syndrome urine samples from the second trimester of pregnancy. Results were normalized to urine creatinine concentration and converted to multiples of the unaffected pregnancy medium (MOM). The concentration of free beta-subunit in Down syndrome cases was 3.9 MOM. Seven of 13 Down syndrome pregnancies (54 per cent) had free beta-subunit levels at or above the 95th centile of unaffected pregnancies. Urine free beta-subunit may potentially be useful as a screening test for Down syndrome.
