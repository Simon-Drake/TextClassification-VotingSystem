Sperm chromosomal abnormalities in patients with unexplained recurrent abortions.
Cytogenetic studies showed that about half of concepti were chromosomally abnormal in first trimester abortions. Sperm chromosomal abnormalities in men with normal karyotype could occur during spermatogenesis. The objective of this study was to evaluate sperm chromosomal abnormalities in patients with unexplained recurrent abortions. A total of 14 couples with normal karyotype, and negative workup for endocrine, immune and anatomical causes of recurrent abortion was investigated. Semen analysis was performed and chromosomal abnormalities were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. The average number of abortions was 5.8. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was 16.5% that was higher when compared to baseline (4.6%). In conclusion, a high rate of sperm chromosomal abnormalities was observed in recurrent abortion patients. These abnormalities might form during spermatogenesis since all patients had normal karyotype. Sperm chromosomal abnormality analysis can be included into recurrent abortion workup when no other cause is detected.
