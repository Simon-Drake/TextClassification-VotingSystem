[Chromosome translocations: study of 232 cases originating from 144 families].
Between 1974 and 1987, 232 translocation carriers have been detected in our Center; they belong to 144 different families. Indications for chromosome analysis were the following: familial studies in relation with a patient suggesting a chromosome anomaly (25.4%); mental retardation with or without malformations (24.6%); 2 or more spontaneous abortions (17.2%); infertility problems, mainly male (16.4%); genetic counseling for a non-chromosomal disease (9.5%); prenatal diagnosis in risk pregnancies (6.9%). The chromosome anomalies detected were the following; balanced Robertsonian fusions (114 cases = 49.1%); balanced translocations (74 cases = 31.9%); unbalanced translocations, Robertsonian fusions included (44 cases = 19%). Two groups may be distinguished: the first one confirms data already known, such as high frequency of balanced translocations in couples with multiple abortions, or in infertile males. The second group on the contrary shows more unusual observations: 4 cases of standard trisomy 21 born to young parents carriers of a balanced translocation not involving chromosome 21; 5 cases of trisomy 13 with 46 chromosomes and a Robertsonian fusion, born to parents carriers of a t(13q; Dq) (twice the mother and thrice the father); 14 cases of apparently balanced translocations, however with an abnormal phenotype; and finally 22 cases of balanced translocations incidentally detected during the course of investigations in patients with a genetic problem generally not associated with a chromosome defect.
