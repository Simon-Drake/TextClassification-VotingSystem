Nonimmunologic hydrops fetalis. A study of ten cases.
Ten cases of hydrops fetalis not associated with serologic incompatibility between mother and infant were studied by autopsy. Classic trisomy 21 was present in two, and in six others the postmortem examination revealed major congenital abnormalities (hydrometrocolpos-polydactyly syndrome, achondrogenesis type 2, congenital adenomatoid malformation of the lung, and aortic valvular dysplasia with left ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis). In two instances, anasarca was associated with a congenital tumor: a sacrococcygeal teratoma and an adrenal neuroblastoma. In six fetuses, prenatal diagnosis of hydrops fetalis or severe congenital malformations was established by ultrasonography.
