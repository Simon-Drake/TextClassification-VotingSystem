Preimplantation genetic diagnosis does not increase pregnancy rates in patients at risk for aneuploidy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) as a method for increasing pregnancy success rates in patients at high risk for aneuploidy. DESIGN: Literature review and discussion of current evidence. CONCLUSION(S): Preimplantation genetic diagnosis selects euploid embryos for transfer in assisted reproduction. Some investigators argue that it might be used to increase pregnancy rates in patient populations at high risk of aneuploidy, such as those with advanced maternal age (AMA), recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), and recurrent IVF failure. Although analysis with PGD confirms a high rate of aneuploidy in patients with AMA, RPL, and recurrent IVF failure, its use in these patient populations has not been consistently shown, in the literature, to increase pregnancy rates. Randomized controlled trials with large patient populations, performed in programs with expertise in PGD technology, are needed before PGD can routinely be recommended as a means for increasing pregnancy rates in patients with AMA, RPL, and recurrent IVF failure.
