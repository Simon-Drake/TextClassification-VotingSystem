Total pregnancy-associated plasma protein A--a first trimester maternal serum marker for Down's syndrome: clinical and technical assessment of a poly-monoclonal enzyme immunoassay.
Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) is a maternal serum marker of fetal chromosomal disease and a risk marker for adverse outcome. PAPP-A in the circulation exists both as a 2:2 complex (PAPP-A/proMBP) with the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP) and as dimeric PAPP-A. Non-PAPP-A containing proMBP complexes constitute the bulk of proMBP in maternal serum. We developed and characterized a sandwich enzyme immunoassay for PAPP-A using a polyclonal rabbit anti-PAPP-A/proMBP antibody (SSI 6823) and a monoclonal murine anti-PAPP-A/proMBP antibody (HYB 234-3), reactive with the PAPP-A part of PAPP-A/proMBP. The assay range was 2 mIU/L-500 mIU/L, intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation <10%. The immunoreactivity eluted ahead of thyroglobulin, Mr 669 kDa, in gel filtration and bound to a heparin column. Serum concentrations of PAPP-A were determined in gestational weeks 5-13 in 167 pregnant women with normal fetuses and 39 women with Down's syndrome (DS) fetuses. The median PAPP-A MoM (multiples of the median in normal controls) in DS pregnancies was 0.30 (quartile range: 0.17-0.54). The PAPP-A logMoMs in DS pregnancies were normally distributed with a mean of -0.5927 and SD of 0.3639. When simulating the performance of PAPP-A and age as markers for DS in population screening a detection rate (DR) of 62% was found for a screen positive rate (SPR) of 5%. Together with beta-HCG and nuchal translucency, two other first trimester markers for fetal DS, a DR 90% could be obtained for an SPR of 5%.
