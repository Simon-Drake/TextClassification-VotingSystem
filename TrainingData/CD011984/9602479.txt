Fetal intrahepatic hyperechogenic foci: prenatal ultrasound diagnosis and outcome.
Fetal intrahepatic hyperechogenic foci were found in seven out of 7260 patients (1:1037) referred to our prenatal centre for a fetal anomaly scan because of an increased risk or suspected presence of fetal structural anomalies. The gestational age varied between 20 and 32 weeks (mean 24 weeks). Fetal karyotyping in three out of seven fetuses resulted in one case of trisomy 18. Additional anomalies were diagnosed in both this case and a case of combined hyperechogenic liver foci, encephalocoele, and unilateral renal agenesis. TORCH and Parvo virus screening was only done in one patient and the results were negative. Outcome was normal in five fetuses with isolated intrahepatic lesions. In the presence of fetal intrahepatic hyperechogenic foci, a detailed scan of the entire fetus should be performed. Screening for infections should continue in order to clarify their role in the development of these intrahepatic lesions. Fetal karyotyping is recommended when additional structural anomalies are present. The outcome of fetuses with isolated hyperechogenic liver foci is generally good.
