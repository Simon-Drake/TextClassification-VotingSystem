Predictability of preimplantation genetic diagnosis of aneuploidy and translocations on prospective attempts.
The aim of this study was to determine if the outcomes of aneuploidy and translocation testing by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) at the 8-cell stage have a predictive value for new genetic diagnosis cycles. In total, 83 cycles (39 patients) undergoing PGD of translocations and 378 cycles (176 patients) of aneuploidy were included. Predictability, defined as having similar rate (+/-20%) of euploid embryos in the first and successive cycles, was found in 66% of patients undergoing aneuploidy testing. Predictability was found significantly more often in patients undergoing PGD of translocations (90%, P = 0.006). In addition, patients with 0, <30 or > or =30% euploid embryos in the first cycle were compared and groups 0 and <30% had significantly fewer euploid embryos in the second cycle (22-26%) than those of the group with > or =30% (37%) (P < 0.05). Patients who did not become pregnant after the first attempt were stimulated more aggressively than those becoming pregnant, producing significantly more embryos in the second than in the first cycle (P < 0.001). Therefore, correlation between euploidy rate and pregnancy rate could not be assessed objectively between cycles. In conclusion, the PGD results of a first cycle can predict the results of the second cycle, but this is likely to be of more value when the condition investigated is translocation rather than aneuploidy. The chance of pregnancy is usually related to the number of euploid embryos.
