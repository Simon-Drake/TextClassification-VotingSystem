Sonographic demonstration of hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the fifth digit: a finding associated with Down syndrome.
Sixty percent of neonates with Down syndrome have hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the fifth digit. We demonstrate this finding sonographically between 17 and 20 weeks' gestation in four of five fetuses with Down syndrome. The appearance of this abnormal phalanx as well as the abnormal curvature of the fifth digit is described.
