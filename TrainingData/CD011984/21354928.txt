[Correlation of fetal chromosomal abnormalities to prenatal ultrasound features].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between fetal chromosomal abnormalities and the characteristic features of prenatal ultrasound findings. METHODS: A total of 510 cases were underwent chromosome examination by amniotic fluid or cord blood analysis to identify fetal chromosomal abnormalities. The correlation between the abnormalities and the characteristics of the prenatal ultrasound findings was analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-three cases of abnormal karyotypes were detected with a positivity rate of 10.2%. Of these cases, 32 cases had chromosome number abnormalities, including 15 with 21-trisomy, 11 with 18-trisomy, 2 with 13-trisomy, 2 with 45, XO monomer and 2 with 92, XXXX tetraploid. Chromosome structural abnormalities were found in 21 cases, including 4 with translocation, 3 with insertion, 6 with inversion, 4 with deletion and 4 with derivation. Prenatal ultrasound showed obvious structural abnormalities in 22 cases (41.5%), structural malformation with ultrasonographic soft markers in 18 cases (34.0%), and separate ultrasonographic soft markers in 8 cases (15.1%). CONCLUSION: Prenatal ultrasound fetal abnormalities and chromosome abnormalities are closely related. Prenatal ultrasound of fetal chromosomal abnormalities usually presents with a variety of significant structural abnormalities. A greater number of malformations is associated with a greater risk of chromosomal abnormalities and increased occurrence of ultrasonographic soft markers.
