Congenital duodenal obstruction. A review of 65 cases.
We report our experience with 65 patients with congenital duodenal obstruction, 36 with intrinsic and 29 with extrinsic lesions. Seventeen patients had trisomy 21 syndrome. Eight pregnancies were complicated by polyhydramnios. The diagnostic features encountered, the operative procedures used, and the postoperative management regimes used are presented. Thirty-two of the 36 patients with intrinsic lesions and 28 of the 29 patients with extrinsic lesions survived. The data on the five patients who died emphasize the effect of multiple congenital anomalies and prematurity on survival. This review suggests that the surgical procedures available for treating patients with congenital duodenal obstruction are well established and yield predictably good results.
