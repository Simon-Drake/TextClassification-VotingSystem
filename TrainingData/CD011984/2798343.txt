The European collaborative study on mosaicism in chorionic villus sampling: data from 1986 to 1987.
Data on a total of 11,855 diagnostic chorionic villus samples obtained in the years 1986 and 1987 were compiled from a questionnaire filled in by 36 European cytogenetic centres. Mosaicism was reported in 141 cases. The cytogenetic findings were followed by induced abortion in 24 cases. Spontaneous abortion was observed in nine mosaic pregnancies, a rate not significantly different from that observed for CVS in total. Mosaicism was found in 1.2 per cent of analyses by direct analysis/short-term culture, in contrast to the 0.6 per cent found after long-term culture. Evidence for fetal non-mosaicism was found in 99 of the 141 cases. The finding of mosaicism in first-trimester CVS should always elicit further analyses, preferably after amniocentesis, to substantiate the suspected fetal chromosome aberration.
