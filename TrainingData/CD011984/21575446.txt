[Screen and identify of differential proteins expressed in the placenta of Down's syndrome].
OBJECTIVE: To discuss protein marks expressed differentially in placenta of Down's syndrome by means of proteomics. METHODS: We collected placenta of 18 patients (from March 2009 to December 2009 at Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital), and divided them into two groups, one was 10 patients with fetal Down's syndrome, the other was normal pregnancies (normal chromosome) with other diseases. We separated proteins expressed in placentas of two groups by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and then analyzed the differential protein spots by software Decyder 6.5, then, spots differentially expressed by 1.5 fold or more were analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). In the end, the differential expressional levels of partially identified proteins were validated by western blot analysis. RESULTS: (1) Differential proteins of two groups protein spots of placentas separated by 2D-DIGE were analyzed by software Decyder 6.5 (these colored lights scattered in the image were protein spots), a total of 56 spots out of 352 were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) in two groups. We analyzed 17 protein spots (12 protein spots were over-expressed and 5 protein spots were down-expressed) differentially expressed by 1.5 fold or more by MALDI-TOF-MS. (2) Protein matching after searching protein database, 17 protein spots turn out to be 10 proteins. Four kinds [superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERP29)] of them were validated by western blot analysis, the group of fetal Down's syndrome were 0.74 +/- 0.12, 0.29 +/- 0.10, 0.53 +/- 0.16, 0.20 +/- 0.09, the group of normal pregnancies were 0.51 +/- 0.08, 0.34 +/- 0.16, 0.18 +/- 0.07, 0.35 +/- 0.09, the results confirmed the observed changes in proteomics. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with normal pregnancies, there were differential proteins expressed in placenta of Down's syndrome. This approach might provide new screening markers in use for prediction of Down's syndrome, however, further study should be done to make these 4 proteins (SOD1, HSP27, ERP29, PRDX6) be new screening markers.
