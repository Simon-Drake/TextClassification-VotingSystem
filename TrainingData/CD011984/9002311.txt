Congenital chylothorax in a patient with 21 trisomy syndrome.
A female infant with 21 trisomy syndrome associated with congenital chylothorax was reported. She was born at a gestational age of 34 weeks by Cesarean section because of fetal hydrothorax and hydrops fetus, confirmed by ultrasonography at 32 weeks. Emergent resuscitation and immediate thoracentesis were performed soon after birth. After beginning breast feeding, the serous pleural fluid became opalescent and a diagnosis of congenital chylothorax was made. Feeding was changed to medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) feeding and the production of pleural effusion disappeared after thoracentesis was performed several times. Accumulating evidence suggested that MCT feeding and intermittent thoracentesis under echo guide were effective. Some reports on patients, including this one, suggest that there may be more patients with 21 trisomy associated with congenital hydrothorax. Therefore, congenital hydrothorax might be listed as a complication of 21 trisomy.
