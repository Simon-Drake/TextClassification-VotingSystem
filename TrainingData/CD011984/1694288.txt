Down syndrome screening in women under 35 with maternal serum hCG.
Human chorionic gonadotropin and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentrations were measured in frozen maternal serum samples from 16 pregnancies with Down syndrome and from 614 unaffected pregnancies in women younger than 35. By using only maternal age and MSAFP level to determine Down syndrome risk, four of 16 (25%) Down syndrome pregnancies were identified, using risk estimates as a screening variable. This detection rate required performing amniocentesis on 4.8% of pregnancies with a normal outcome. By adding hCG level as a third risk parameter, ten of 16 (62.5%) Down syndrome pregnancies were detected. To achieve this detection rate, 4.7% of women under 35 would be recommended for amniocentesis. These results indicate that the estimation of risk for Down syndrome based on the addition of maternal hCG level to MSAFP level and maternal age will substantially improve the detection rate for Down syndrome, with no change in the amniocentesis rate. These findings are in agreement with other studies that suggest that hCG is a valuable addition to screening programs for Down syndrome.
