Rapid prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 18 and triploidy in interphase nuclei of uncultured amniocytes by non-radioactive in situ hybridization.
Two biotinylated chromosome-specific DNA probes were used to quantify the number of chromosomes 18 and 1 in uncultured amniocytes. Thirty-three samples of uncultured amniocytes were hybridized with a chromosome 18-specific DNA probe. Uncultured cells from two of the 33 samples were also hybridized with a chromosome 1-specific probe. Thirty of the samples were disomic with respect to chromosome 18; two samples were trisomic with respect to chromosome 18, and one sample was trisomic with respect to chromosomes 1 and 18. The two cases of trisomy 18 and the single case of triploidy were identified on uncultured cells within 48-72 h after amniocentesis. They were found among five samples from pregnant women who had amniocentesis because of an ultrasonographically identified fetal malformation. A trisomic karyotype could be diagnosed with certainty in uncultured amniocytes because the majority of the responding nuclei exhibited three hybridization signals. In normal cells, the majority of nuclei exhibited two signals. In no cases was there discordance between the genotype as predicted by in situ hybridization and that determined by cytogenetic analysis.
