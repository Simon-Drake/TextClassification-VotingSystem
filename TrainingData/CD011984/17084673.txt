PGD for aneuploidy screening: an expensive hoax?
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening (PGD-AS) constitutes a technique developed to improve embryo selection in patients with a poor outcome after in-vitro fertilization treatment due to an increased frequency of numerical chromosome abnormalities in the embryos. Although multiple studies have evaluated the performance of PGD-AS in different groups of patients, inconsistencies in the evidence available have not enabled definitive conclusions to be drawn. According to randomized trials, PGD-AS does not improve the outcome of women of advanced age when there is no limitation on the number of embryos to be transferred. In patients who have experienced recurrent implantation failure or recurrent miscarriage, AS only seems to provide diagnostic information, especially when aneuploid embryos alone are found. Additional evidence is needed before AS is implemented as part of routine clinical practice.
