Prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling: lessons of the first 600 cases.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) has emerged as a first trimester alternative to amniocentesis for the prenatal detection of genetic disorders. We report our experience in 600 consecutive CVS procedures to better delineate the safety, efficacy and reliability of this new method of prenatal diagnosis. Adequate samples were obtained at the initial visit in 97 per cent of the cases, and successful cultures were established in 98.7 per cent of these patients. Chromosome abnormalities were detected in 5.9 percent of those pregnancies tested because of advanced maternal age (greater than or equal to 35 years). A discrepancy between the villus karyotype and that of the fetus was found in 2.0 per cent of cases, and most commonly consisted of mosaicism in the villus sample for a chromosomal abnormality that was not found in fetal samples. The risk of spontaneous abortion following the procedure was 6.3 per cent. We conclude that chorionic villus sampling is an acceptably safe and reliable procedure, but further investigation is needed before it can become an established technique in prenatal diagnosis.
