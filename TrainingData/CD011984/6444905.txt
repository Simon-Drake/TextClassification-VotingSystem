[Peculiarities of pregnancies in women in the fifth decade of life (author's transl)].
From 1974-1978, 101 women in the fifth decade of life were delivered. The course of the pregnancy was more often complicated by pre-eclampsia. Premature and dysmature deliveries were not more common than in younger women. The sex ratio was more in favor of females than usual. Despite shorter duration of labor and delivery the Apgar ratings at 1 and 5 minutes were less favorable in the new borns of older pregnant women. The infants required more often intubation and transfer to the pediatric hospital. The perinatal mortality was 4.2%. Down syndrome occured in 4.2% of the infants and abnormalities occured in 4.9%. Routine genetic amniocentesis and intensive pregnantal care should lower the fetal morbidity and mortality in these cases. Urinary total estrogen determinations are proposed as a parameter for the monitoring of the these risk cases besided ultra-sound and fetal monitoring.
