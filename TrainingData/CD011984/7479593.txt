Urinary multiple marker screening for Down's syndrome.
We have examined the possibility of using multiple markers in maternal urine rather than serum in order to screen for Down's syndrome. Urine samples were available from 36 cases (24 Down's syndrome, five Edwards' syndrome, three Turner's syndrome, one Klinefelter's syndrome, one triploidy, one triple-X, one twin discordant for Down's syndrome) and 294 controls, including three twins. Three markers were tested: the beta-core fragment of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), total oestrogen (tE) and the free alpha subunit of hCG. Levels were corrected for creatinine excretion and expressed as multiples of the gestation-specific median (MOM) level from the singleton controls. The median value for the singleton Down's syndrome cases was 6.02, 0.74, and 1.08 MOM for beta-core-hCG, tE, and alpha-hCG, respectively. The increases in beta-core-hCG and the reduction in tE levels were highly significant (P < 0.0001 and 0.005, respectively; Wilcoxon rank sum test) but the increase in free alpha-hCG was not (P = 0.40). On the basis of a mathematical model, the expected detection rate for a 5 per cent false-positive rate was 79.6 per cent for beta-core-hCG alone, which increased to 82.3 per cent when combined with tE. Aneuploidies other than Down's syndrome were characterized by low levels of tE and either low or high beta-core-hCG.
