[Noninvasive prenatal genetic diagnosis: a bioethical reflection on the use of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis from the analysis of nucleic acids present in maternal peripheral blood].
The use of techniques that analyse the fetal nucleic acids present in maternal peripheral blood for the preparation of non-invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis, is a clinical reality in the case of certain diseases. In the coming years, it will become part of the routine monitoring for fetal diagnosis. This study analyzes the current status of these techniques as well as the major ethical issues arising from the relationship between - prenatal diagnosis and eugenic abortion, and the specific problems posed by - prenatal genetic diagnosis based an analysis of the nucleic acids present in maternal peripheral blood. Among the conclusions are the following: we make a positive ethical evaluation of the technique when it is aimed at pregnant women who are in a situation of high risk, defined on the basis of medical standards and ethics, without compromising the integrity of the fetus. We make a negative ethical evaluation when non-invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis has a eugenic purpose and will establish a connection between prenatal diagnosis and eugenic abortion in case of a positive result. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis increases the image of the disabled person as an individual that has to be excluded from society. The widespread use of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis will decrease the autonomy of women / couples when it comes to making decisions. Health authorities may use non-invasive prenatal diagnosis as a way of ''preventing'' genetic diseases, since it will lower costs, increase the number of malformed fetuses detected and a decrease the number of indirect abortions involving invasive techniques.
