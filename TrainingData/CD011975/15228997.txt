Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, free beta-hCG, nuchal translucency, and risk of pregnancy loss.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the likelihood of clinical early and late pregnancy loss as a function of first-trimester maternal serum analytes and fetal nuchal translucency measurements. METHODS: Study subjects were recruited for a National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-sponsored multicenter cohort study initially designed to study the detection of Down syndrome during the first trimester of pregnancy. The cohort consisted of women who had a live fetus between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation and had no significant vaginal bleeding. Women with prior fetal trisomy (T21/18) and those with structural or chromosomal abnormalities in the index pregnancy were excluded. First-trimester screening consisted of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), free beta-hCG, and nuchal translucency. Pregnancy loss rates in women with various levels of PAPP-A, free beta-hCG, or nuchal translucency (less than 1st, less than 5th, more than 95th, and more than 99th percentile) were compared with losses in women with normal values (5th to 95th percentile). RESULTS: The mean gestational age at screening of 7,932 women meeting study criteria was 12.1 weeks. Loss rates were only 0.36% at less than 20 weeks after normal free beta-hCG, PAPP-A, and nuchal translucency. Conversely, low levels of PAPP-A and free beta-hCG as well as increased nuchal translucency were individually associated with increased early loss. These associations persisted after controlling for maternal age and race using logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Normal values of PAPP-A, free beta-hCG, and nuchal translucency are associated with a very low risk of pregnancy loss at less than 20 weeks.
