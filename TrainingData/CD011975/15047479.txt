[Placenta associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A): clinical value in cardiovascular medicine].
PAPP-A is high molecular weight metalloproteinase originally identified in the serum of pregnant women. During pregnancy, the concentration of PAPP-A increases in maternal circulation with gestational age. Depressed levels, associated with an abnormal placental function, have formed the basis of the first trimester screening for Down syndrome. The role of PAPP-A in tissue other than placenta has only recently been explored. More recently elevated serum concentrations of PAPP-A have been identified in patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infract. It has thus been proposed as a potential early indicator of acute coronary syndrome.
