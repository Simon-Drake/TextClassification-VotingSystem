Maternal serum screening for Down's syndrome, open neural tube defects and trisomy 18.
Maternal serum screening identifies women at an increased risk of a pregnancy with Down's syndrome or trisomy 18 or an open neural tube defect. The triple test, consisting of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated estriol and human chorionic gonadotropin was carried out by a chemiluminescence immunoassay method in our laboratory. The study consisted of 373 pregnant women. The gestational range for the study group was 14-22 weeks. The mean maternal age for the study group was 28.53 +/- 5.46 years (range 17.4 to 43.5 years); 9.1% of the women were considered at high risk for Down's syndrome based on the test results. In our study the detection rate for Down's syndrome by prenatal karyotyping was 66.6%. Maternal serum screening allows reduction of the number of women requiring amniocentesis without a significant decrease in the detection rate.
