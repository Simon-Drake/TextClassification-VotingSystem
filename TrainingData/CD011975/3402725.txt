Cytogenetic studies of couples with repeated spontaneous abortions of known karyotype.
Several cytogenetic studies have reported an increased frequency of aneuploidy in peripheral blood cultures of couples with multiple spontaneous abortions. However, in none of the studies have the chromosome constitutions of the fetuses been known, making it difficult to interpret these observations. In the present study, we summarize our cytogenetic observations on 23 couples with multiple miscarriages, 12 of whom had repeated chromosomally normal spontaneous abortions, and 11 repeated trisomic spontaneous abortions. We were unable to demonstrate a significant difference in the level of aneuploidy between the two groups. Therefore, it seems unlikely that aneuploidy detectable in peripheral blood preparations is an important indicator of fetal aneuploidy.
