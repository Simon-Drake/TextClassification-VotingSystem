Elevated maternal second-trimester serum alpha-fetoprotein as a risk factor for placental abruption.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) and free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (MSbeta-hCG) levels to placental abruption. METHODS: Fifty-seven women with placental abruption and 108 control women without placental abruption were tested for second-trimester MSAFP and MSbeta-hCG levels as a part of a trisomy 21 screening program. Discriminatory cutoff levels for MSAFP were sought to predict placental abruption. RESULTS: The median of the MSAFP multiples of median (MoM) (1.21) was significantly higher in the abruption group than in the control group (1.07) (p = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, elevated MSAFP remained an independent risk factor for placental abruption when adjusting for other risk factors (parity >/= 3, smoking, previous placental abruption, preeclampsia, bleeding in II or III trimester, and placenta previa). MSAFP >/= 1.5 MoM had a sensitivity of 29% and a false-positive rate of 10%. The levels of the MSbeta-hCG MoM did not differ between the cases and the controls. CONCLUSION: Although second-trimester MSAFP levels are higher in women with subsequent placental abruption, the clinical usefulness of this test is limited due to low sensitivity and high false-positive rate.
