Diagnostic transabdominal amnioinfusion in a case of anhydramnion and fetal kidney dysplasia.
Diagnostic transabdominal amnioinfusion was performed at 32 weeks of gestation in a case of anhydramnion. Before saline infusion, no exact fetal structures could be identified by sonography. Also, there was a total diastolic block in the fetal aorta (FA) and umbilical artery (UA). After infusion of 270ml of saline, the diastolic blocks in the FA and UA disappeared, and, after another infusion of 410ml of saline, severe fetal congenital kidney abnormalities were identified. Transabdominal amnioinfusion is a practical aid to fetal sonography in severe oligohydramnion and anhydramnion.
