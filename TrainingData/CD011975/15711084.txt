Prenatal testing guidelines: time for a new approach.
Numerous advances over the past 15 years have led to a much wider array of prenatal testing options for pregnant women who are interested in obtaining information regarding the chromosomal status of their fetus. However, despite recent data calling into question the assumptions underlying current testing guidelines, including those inherent in the risk-based threshold for offering invasive testing, chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis are still typically offered only to women whose likelihood of carrying a fetus affected by a chromosomal disorder such as Down syndrome is at least as high as that of the average 35-year-old. In this paper, we summarize the evidence suggesting that this aspect of prenatal testing guidelines should be revisited, and that women should be allowed to make informed decisions regarding the use of invasive testing that are reflective of their own values and preferences.
