Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein in fetal anal atresia and other gastro-intestinal obstructions.
The fetal gastro-intestinal (GI) tract contributes to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in amniotic fluid and hence to those in maternal serum (MS). This study retrospectively analysed results of second trimester MSAFP screening in cases of fetal GI tract obstruction. 18 cases of fetal GI obstruction were diagnosed amongst 17,036 women who underwent MSAFP screening between 1979 and 1997: seven had oesophageal atresia, four had duodenal atresia, six had anal atresia, and one had both anal and oesophageal atresia. MSAFP in pregnancies of a fetus with anal atresia was significantly lower than the population median. MSAFP in cases of fetal oesophageal or duodenal atresia was low but these differences did not reach significance.
