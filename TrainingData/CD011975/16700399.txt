Maternal serum screening of Palestinian women in the West Bank.
An audit was made of laboratory records of triple test results from 943 Palestinian women residing in the West Bank from 2000-03. The mean expected age at delivery of the subjects was 25.5 years; 12% were 35 years old or above. Age was the main factor associated with an abnormal calculated risk score. The frequency of elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein was 1.3%, abnormal human choriogonic gonadotropin (elevated or reduced) was 1.9% and reduced unconjugated estriol was 0.3%.
