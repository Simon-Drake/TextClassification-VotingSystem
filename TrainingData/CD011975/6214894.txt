[Learning disabilities and genetics with particular reference to Down's syndrome].
Medical geneticists invest a great part of their resources towards the prevention of the birth of children with trisomy 21. Since, however, it will never be possible to monitor all pregnancies and, moreover, rejection of prenatal diagnosis on ethical grounds is widespread, this paper discusses the possibilities of lightening the burden on relatives of children with Down's syndrome. The contrast of the negative example shown by Switzerland with positive experiences achieved in Denmark serves to show that highly beneficial results can be obtained by humanizing the school system. This holds true not only for the severely retarded and their families, but also for children with minor learning disabilities as well. Such changes in the school system, when correctly applied, are of advantage to more gifted students as well.
