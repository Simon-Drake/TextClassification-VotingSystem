Outcomes for fetal echogenic bowel during the second trimester ultrasound.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between fetal echogenic bowel (FEB) during the second trimester and perinatal outcome. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of FEB during the second trimester over 3 years. RESULTS: A total of 56 women were identified of 9067 screened (0.6%) women. Forty-seven agreed to genetic counseling (84%). Of those, 22 (39%) agreed to an amniocentesis. There were three cases of trisomy 21, one case of trisomy 18 and one case of fetal CMV infection. Twelve fetuses had an adverse outcome (21%), with only three of them having an echogenic bowel as the only finding. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, almost 80% of the fetuses had an uncomplicated perinatal outcome. FEB was present as the only finding in only 5% of the fetuses with an adverse outcome. A potential association with placental abnormalities and a low prevalence of viral infections was observed. These findings may be of use in counseling parents.
