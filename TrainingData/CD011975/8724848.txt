Identification of a novel human gene containing the tetratricopeptide repeat domain from the Down syndrome region of chromosome 21.
The Down syndrome (DS) region on chromosome 21, which is responsible for the DS main features, has been defined by analysis of DS patients with partial trisomy 21. Within the DS region, we constructed a 1.6-Mb P1 contig map previously. To isolate gene fragments from the 1.6-Mb region, we performed direct cDNA library screening and exon trapping using the P1 clones and a human fetal brain cDNA library, and obtained 67 cDNA fragments and 52 possible exons. Among them, 23 cDNA fragments and 4 exons were interpreted to be derived from a single gene by localization on P1 clones and by Northern analysis. To obtain the full-length cDNA sequence, longer cDNA clones were further screened from another human cDNA library which was enriched with longer cDNA species. These clones were sequenced and assembled to a sequence of 9045 bp. This transcribed sequence encodes a novel 2025 amino-acid protein containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs and therefore the gene was designated as TPRD (a gene containing the TPR motifs on the Down syndrome region). The TPR domain has been found in a certain protein phosphatase and in other proteins involved in the regulation of RNA synthesis or mitosis. The TPRD gene, the novel gene which was proved to be in the 1.6-Mb region and to have the interesting features described above, is a candidate for genes responsible for the DS phenotypes.
