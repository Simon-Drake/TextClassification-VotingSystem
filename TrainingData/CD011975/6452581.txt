[Etiology of mongolism].
Beside the rare cares of translocation mongolism, Down syndrome is caused by meiotic malsegregation of chromosomes, No. 21. The meiotic error can take place in both sexes and was found twice as frequently in the female as in the male. The same 2:1 ratio was found concerning nondisjunction in the first and in the second meiotic division. The rate of meiotic errors, which occur at random, is largely dependent on age; this tendency is more pronounced in oogenesis than in spermatogenesis. The results of prenatal chromosomal diagnosis indicate that the recurrence risk of trisomy 21 is not above the age-dependent average.
