[Screening for trisomy 21 by measuring nuchal translucency during the first trimester of pregnancy].
The purpose of the present literature review is to assess the screening value of trisomy 21 by measurement of fetal nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester. NT is a subcutaneous translucency between the skin and the soft tissues overlying the cervical spine, which disappears in the second trimester. Ultrasound examination was used to image a sagittal section of the fetus to measure the maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucency. NT is physiological for a measurement < 3 mm but the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities (essentially trisomies 21, 18 and 13) increases when NT > or = 3 mm. Differential diagnoses include cystic hygroma and fetal hydrops. For screening purposes, a cut-off threshold value of > or = 3 mm, with a standardized technique, gave a sensitivity > or = 50%, a false positive rate < 5% and a positive predictive value > 1%. In the chromosomally normal group, prognosis was good, but incidence of structural defects and fetal loss increased, with a sharp rise in these complications for fetal translucency thickness > or = 5 mm.
