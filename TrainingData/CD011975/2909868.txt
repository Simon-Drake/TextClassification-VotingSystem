Case-control cytogenetic study in offspring of mothers treated with bromocriptine during early pregnancy.
The distribution of modal and non-modal karyotypes was examined in mitoses of lymphocyte cultures of 31 children who had been exposed to bromocriptine in utero, and in 31 matched controls. No mosaicism was diagnosed. Furthermore, no more hypomodal cells occurred in the study group than in the control group.
