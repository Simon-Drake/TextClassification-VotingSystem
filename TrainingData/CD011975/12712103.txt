A characteristic cluster of fetal sonographic markers that are predictive of fetal Turner syndrome in early pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe a characteristic cluster of sonographic features of fetuses with Turner syndrome in early pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A targeted transvaginal ultrasound examination of all fetal organs was performed for 40123 consecutive pregnant women at 14 to 16 weeks of gestation. Both low- and high-risk pregnancies were included. Fetal karyotyping was performed in 9348 cases. The main indications were major fetal anomalies, advanced maternal age, abnormal biochemical markers, maternal anxiety, and request. RESULTS: Turner syndrome was detected in 13 fetuses (0.03%, 1/3086 early pregnancies). Huge septated cystic hygroma, severe subcutaneous edema, and hydrops were observed in all cases. A short femur was detected in 12 of 13 fetuses. A narrow aortic arch was visualized in all 8 fetuses who were scanned after 1995, when scanning of the aortic arch became mandatory in our institution. Four other fetuses had three or four of the five markers, 2 of the fetuses had trisomy 21, 1 fetus was normal, and one case of missed abortion occurred without a karyotype. CONCLUSION: A reliable diagnosis of Turner syndrome by sonographic means is possible in early pregnancy.
