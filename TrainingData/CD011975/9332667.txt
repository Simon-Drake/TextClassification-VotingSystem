True trisomy 2 mosaicism in amniocytes and newborn liver associated with multiple system abnormalities.
Among 58,000 amniocenteses completed, our laboratories found one case of true cytogenetic trisomy 2 mosaicism in a fetus with multiple abnormalities. In contrast, 11 fetuses phenotypically normal at birth were found to have true trisomy 2 mosaicism in their chorionic villus cells among the 10,500 fetuses tested by chorionic villus sampling (CVS). In our single abnormal case, amniocentesis performed at 19 weeks after finding an elevated maternal serum AFP found two independent cultures with trisomy 2 karyotypes in 8 of 25 and 7 of 31 amniocytes, respectively. Although oligohydramnios was noted by ultrasound, the mother elected to continue the pregnancy. At 26 weeks the fetus had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), hydronephrosis, and cardiac abnormalities. When delivered by Cesarean section at 30 weeks, the infant had multiple anomalies and developed necrotizing enterocolitis and severe cholestasis. At 5 months coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed delayed myelination and abnormal brain morphology. The patient also exhibited significant growth failure and developmental delay. Although chromosomes were normal in blood, skin fibroblasts, and ascites fluid cells, 4 of 100 hepatic biopsy fibroblasts were 47,XY,+2. Molecular analysis excluded uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 2 in the 46,XY cell line. This and other reports of rare phenotypically abnormal trisomy 2 mosaic fetuses identified by karyotyping amniocytes emphasizes the substantially higher fetal risk of abnormal development than when trisomy 2 is found only in chorionic villus cells.
