A specific phenotype associated with trisomy 15 mosaicism.
In this report the authors describe the phenotype of a female newborn with trisomy 15 mosaicism and double aneuploidy (47, XX, +15/47, XXX). Comparison with the two other patients with trisomy 15 mosaicism reported up to now, reveals a distinct phenotype with typical craniofacial dysmorphism, severe hypotonia and general symptoms and signs compatible with a fetal akinesia sequence.
