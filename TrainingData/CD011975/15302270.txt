Over a decade of experience with preimplantation genetic diagnosis: a multicenter report.
OBJECTIVE: To review a 12-year experience of the world's three largest preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) centers. DESIGN: Multicenter analysis of the clinical outcome of PGD. SETTING: In vitro fertilization programs at the Reproductive Genetics Institute, Chicago, Illinois; Saint Barnabas Medical Center, West Orange, New Jersey; and SISMER, Bologna, Italy. PATIENT(S): Poor-prognosis IVF patients, patients carrying balanced chromosomal translocations, and couples at risk for producing children with Mendelian disorders. INTERVENTION(S): In vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, polar body removal, blastomere biopsy, and ET. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): DNA or chromosomal analysis of biopsied polar bodies or blastomeres, implantation and clinical pregnancy rates, and live-born pregnancy outcome. RESULT(S): A total of 754 babies have been born as a result of 4,748 PGD attempts, which shows the expanded application and the practical relevance of PGD for single-gene disorders, chromosomal aneuploidies and translocations, late-onset diseases with genetic predisposition, and nondisease testing in couples at need for human leukocyte antigens-matched offspring for treatment of affected siblings. CONCLUSION(S): Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is evolving to become a clinical option for couples at risk for producing offspring with Mendelian diseases, has a positive numerical impact in standard assisted reproduction practices through aneuploidy testing, and reduces by at least fourfold the spontaneous abortion rate in couples carrying translocations.
