Maternal serum screening for Down syndrome: are women's perceptions changing?
OBJECTIVES: To document trends in serum screening for Down's syndrome. BACKGROUND: Trends in the uptake of serum screening for Down syndrome have not been documented in a UK population. DESIGN: A retrospective review of the rate of uptake in a unit that has offered serum screening for Down syndrome to all pregnant women. SETTING: A large north of England hospital that has offered universal Down syndrome screening using the 'triple test' since 1992. PATIENTS: A total of 47,998 women who booked for antenatal care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uptake of serum screening for Down syndrome. METHODS: The results of the screening programme were contemporaneously recorded on a computer database, and the study team accessed the data. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the uptake of serum screening for Down syndrome from a maximum of 82.6% in 1993 to 41.4% in 2005. There was a significant but small trend upwards in the age of women accepting screening and also a significant trend in the increase in the screen-positive rates. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in uptake of Down syndrome screening over the past 13 years must be taken into account when planning a screening programme. Other units should be encouraged to review their rate of uptake to determine if our data are representative of a wider trend.
