Screening for Down syndrome based on maternal age or fetal nuchal translucency: a randomized controlled trial in 39,572 pregnancies.
OBJECTIVES: Nuchal translucency (NT) screening increases antenatal detection of Down syndrome (DS) compared to maternal age-based screening. We wanted to determine if a change in policy for prenatal diagnosis would result in fewer babies born with DS. METHODS: A total of 39,572 pregnant women were randomized to a scan at 12-14 gestational weeks including NT screening for DS (12-week group) or to a scan at 15-20 weeks with screening for DS based on maternal age (18-week group). Fetal karyotyping was offered if risk according to NT was > or = 1:250 in the 12-week group and if maternal age was > or = 35 years in the 18-week group. Both policies included the offer of karyotyping in cases of fetal anomaly detected at any scan during pregnancy or when there was a history of fetal chromosomal anomaly. The number of babies born with DS and the number of invasive tests for fetal karyotyping were compared. RESULTS: Ten babies with DS were born alive with the 12-week policy vs. 16 with the 18-week policy (P = 0.25). More fetuses with DS were spontaneously lost or terminated in the 12-week group (45/19,796) than in the 18-week group (27/19 776; P = 0.04). All women except one with an antenatal diagnosis of DS at < 22 weeks terminated the pregnancy. For each case of DS detected at < 22 weeks in a living fetus there were 16 invasive tests in the 12-week group vs. 89 in the 18-week group. NT screening detected 71% of cases of DS for a 3.5% test-positive rate whereas maternal age had the potential of detecting 58% for a test-positive rate of 18%. CONCLUSIONS: The number of newborns with DS differed less than expected between pregnancies that had been screened at 12-14 weeks' gestation by NT compared with those screened at 15-20 weeks by maternal age. One explanation could be that NT screening--because it is performed early in pregnancy--results in the detection and termination of many pregnancies with a fetus with DS that would have resulted in miscarriage without intervention, and also by many cases of DS being detected because of a fetal anomaly seen on an 18-week scan. The major advantage of the 12-week scan policy is that many fewer invasive tests for fetal karyotyping are needed per antenatally detected case of DS.
