Maternal serum inhibin-A in pregnancies complicated by insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
We have examined whether insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) affects maternal serum levels of inhibin-A, a recently described prenatal marker of Down's syndrome, by comparing levels in 169 women with IDDM with levels in 432 nondiabetic pregnant women between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation. There was a small but significant increase in the inhibin-A level in the diabetic women only when levels were corrected for maternal weight: median MoM 1.17 (P < 0.01 vs controls, Student's t test). The underlying mechanism for this elevation in pregnancies complicated by IDDM currently remains obscure.
