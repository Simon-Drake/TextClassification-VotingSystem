The mathematical basis of multivariate risk screening: with special reference to screening for Down's syndrome associated pregnancy.
The underlying mathematical techniques behind the multivariate normal distribution are explained in principle and expanded in detail for up to three variables. The application of multivariate distributions to screening programs is described with particular reference to the calculation of risk ratios for the detection of Down's syndrome between 15 and 19 weeks of gestation.
