Quality of written information used in Down syndrome screening.
A qualitative assessment was performed on 81 leaflets used in maternal serum Down syndrome screening from National Health Service (NHS) obstetric units and private screening services. Quality was assessed by factual content, presentation and reading ease and this was amalgamated into a single overall score expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score. Eleven (14%) leaflets included all eight factual items recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG); only one included these and a further nine items recognised as important to the consumer. Three (4%) leaflets contained information that was incorrect and 17 (21%) that was misleading or inconsistent. Using published criteria six (7%) leaflets were well presented and ten (12%) were fairly easy to read. The average reading age was 13-14 years. The overall quality score showed that five leaflets had 80% or more of the total possible score. However a substantial number, 15 (19%), were totally unacceptable having scores of 40% or less. In general the quality of leaflets used in the UK is considered poor. A national peer-reviewed leaflet should be prepared which can be modified to suit local policy.
