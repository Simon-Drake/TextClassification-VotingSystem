Birth defects--the state of awareness amongst mothers.
Birth defects have in recent years become the major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. The incidence of birth defects is between 2% to 6% of all live births. However, from a survey carried out in Singapore General Hospital (SGH), the majority of mothers enter pregnancy without realising the risks that they or their offspring may face. Only 20% to 25% of mothers were aware of the actual incidence of birth defects, and only 2.5%-10% knew that the risk of Down Syndrome (DS) increases with maternal age. However, the use of ultrasound is now well accepted and is considered a necessary investigation by 90% of the mothers surveyed.
