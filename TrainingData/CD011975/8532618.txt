Maternal platelet size as a marker for fetal trisomies 18 and 13.
Maternal and fetal platelet size and glycoprotein expression were measured in 14 pregnancies complicated by fetal aneuploidy between 20 and 24 weeks' gestation. Flow cytometry was used to determine platelet size and surface glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) and GPIIIa expression both before and after stimulation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The data were compared with results obtained from 35 normal paired maternal and fetal controls. In fetuses affected with trisomies 18 and 13, but not trisomy 21, the maternal and fetal platelet sizes were significantly higher than those of the normal controls. Furthermore, the increase in fetal platelet size was significantly associated with the increase in maternal platelet size. Increase in maternal platelet size may be of potential value as a marker for fetal trisomies 18 and 13.
