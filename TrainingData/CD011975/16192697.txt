Effect of paternal age on the frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in human spermatozoa.
Many surveys have been performed to find etiological relationships between pregnancy outcome and specific risk factors, such as exposure to chemicals and radiation or parental age. Advanced maternal age is a strong risk factor for trisomic pregnancies, albeit there are considerable variations among the different chromosomes. The definite incidence of the various structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in spontaneous abortions and liveborns is well known, as well as the rate of maternally and paternally derived rearrangements. Nevertheless studies have failed to assert an age-dependent risk for men fathering chromosomally abnormal children. New techniques using fluorescence in situ hybridization render it possible to analyze spermatozoa directly for numerical and, to some extent, for structural aberrations. This article compiles the findings of studies on human spermatozoa over the last few years.
