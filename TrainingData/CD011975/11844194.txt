Uterine artery Doppler at 11-14 weeks of gestation in chromosomally abnormal fetuses.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the major chromosomal abnormalities are associated with impaired placentation in the first trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 692 singleton pregnancies undergoing fetal karyotyping at 11-14 weeks of gestation. Uterine artery Doppler was carried out and the mean pulsatility index was calculated just before chorionic villus sampling. RESULTS: The fetal karyotype was normal in 613 pregnancies and abnormal in 79, including 39 cases of trisomy 21, 11 of trisomy 18, 11 of trisomy 13, eight of Turner syndrome and 10 with other defects. There were no significant differences in the median value of uterine artery mean PI between any of the individual groups. Although in the combined group of trisomy 18, trisomy 13 and Turner syndrome fetuses, the median pulsatility index (1.60) was significantly higher than in the chromosomally normal group (median pulsatility index, 1.51; P = 0.021), in the majority of abnormal fetuses (24 of 30) mean pulsatility index was below the 95th centile of the normal group (mean pulsatility index, 2.34). There was no significant association between uterine artery mean pulsatility index and fetal nuchal translucency thickness or fetal growth deficit. CONCLUSIONS: The high intrauterine lethality and fetal growth restriction associated with the major chromosomal abnormalities are unlikely to be the consequence of impaired placentation in the first trimester of pregnancy.
