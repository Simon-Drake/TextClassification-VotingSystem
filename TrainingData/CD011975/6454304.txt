[A 5-year review of prenatal diagnosis in Graz (author's transl)].
Between 1/7/1974 and 30/6/1979 we analysed 532 amniotic fluid cell cultures. In 402 cases a genetic indication for amniocentesis was given; 57 prenatal diagnoses were carried out for gynaecological and other medical indications. We also analysed 73 amniotic fluid test samples. Altogether 19 pathological results (3.6%) were found. We observed 16 abnormal findings in 459 diagnostic amniocenteses and 3 pathological results in the test cultures. The transmission of parental chromosomal polymorphisms to the fetus is discussed here. The importance of prenatal diagnosis in genetic counselling, along with cost-benefit reflections, are stressed in this paper.
