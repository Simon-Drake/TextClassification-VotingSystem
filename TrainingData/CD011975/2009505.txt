Chromosome analysis guidelines preliminary report.
These guidelines have been developed by the Association of Cytogenetic Technologists (ACT) for chromosome analysis. In formulating its recommendations, the task force reviewed guidelines established by several states and regional genetics groups. Draft guidelines prepared by the task force were reviewed by a panel of expert consultants, all of whom are laboratory directors and well known in their respective fields of expertise. The intention of the task force was to reflect procedures that are believed to be generally accepted by cytogenetic laboratories as basic criteria for effective chromosome analysis and that are consistent with existing cytogenetic quality assurance guidelines. It is important to stress that the primary purpose of the task force at this time is to establish guidelines for chromosome analysis. While the present guidelines address issues other than chromosome analysis, they do so incidentally and only in general terms. A more comprehensive discussion of other technical aspects of cytogenetics can be found in the forthcoming second edition of the ACT Cytogenetics Laboratory Manual. It is important to note that these guidelines are not intended to prescribe appropriate analyses for all individual circumstances. That determination is appropriately a matter for the judgment of the laboratories concerned. ACT, its members, and the task force that assisted in preparation of these guidelines make no warranty and assume no liability with respect to the information contained herein.
