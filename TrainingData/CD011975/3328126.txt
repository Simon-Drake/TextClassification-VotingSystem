Recurrent aneuploidic and euploidic abortion.
The evaluation of recurrent embryopathy in man is one of the most difficult tasks. The physician must clearly recognize which couples are experiencing recurrent euploidic abortion and which couples are experiencing recurrent aneuploidic abortion. A firm knowledge of the cytogenetic character of the abortion material enables one to make the next step, namely to determine the source of error in gametogenesis. Techniques are gradually becoming available to identify the source of the parental gametogenic area. In addition, new methods to detect molecular mutation in euploidic abortion are gradually evolving. The establishment of normal protein profiles by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in normal abortions should enable one to screen recurrent embryopathy in man for abnormal proteins. Abnormal proteins, once identified, can enable us to identify the specific DNA mutation that may be at the heart of the problem.
