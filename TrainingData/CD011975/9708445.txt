Chromosomal anomalies in abnormal human pregnancies.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the cytogenetic observations on abnormal human pregnancies (anembryonic pregnancy, early fetal loss, and hydatidiform moles), and to detect the most frequent or typical chromosomal aberration for anembryonic pregnancy and early fetal loss. STUDY DESIGN: Abnormal pregnancies were divided into three clinical and morphological groups: (a) anembryonic pregnancy; (b) early fetal loss, and (c) hydatidiform mole. Of the 119 karyotyped tissue samples, 42 (35%) were from anembryonic pregnancies, 64 (54%) from early fetal losses, and 13 (11%) were from hydatidiform moles (6 complete and 7 partial moles). Long-term cultures of chorionic villi and GTG-banding techniques were used for chromosome analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The overall frequency of chromosome anomalies among the 119 karyotyped spontaneous abortions was found to be 37.8%. Trisomy (double trisomy included) accounted for 35.6% of all aberrations, followed by polyploidy (33.3%), mosaicism (11.1%), structural abnormalities (4.4%), and monosomy X (2.2%). Although the difference was not statistically significant, single trisomy was the predominant chromosome abnormality found in anembryonic pregnancies (64.3 %) while in cases of early fetal loss, trisomy (double trisomy included) (38.9%) and triploidy (27.8%) were quite frequently present. The frequency of triploidy among all chromosomal abnormalities was 28.9%, and 53.8% of them were found in partial hydatidiform mole. The rest of them were almost exclusively found in early fetal losses. Complete hydatidiform moles (androgenetic in origin) were present in 13.3% of all aberrations, of which 83.3% had a 46,XX, and the rest of them had a 46,XY karyotype.
