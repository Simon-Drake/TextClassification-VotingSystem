Current topic: trophoblastic pathology.
Selected topics in trophoblastic pathology which are arousing current interest are briefly reviewed. These include the concept of villitis as a non-specific immunological lesion, changing views on the distinction between partial and complete hydatidiform mole, a reconsideration of the role of inadequate placentation in pregnancy hypertension and in spontaneous abortion, the significance of confined placental mosaicism and the importance of infection and defective collagen synthesis in premature rupture of the membranes.
