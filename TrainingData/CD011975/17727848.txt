The influence of sperm morphology on preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles outcome.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of abnormal sperm morphology on the rates of aneuploidy, implantation, and clinical pregnancy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University-based IVF center. PATIENT(S): Fifty-two patients undergoing their first IVF-preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycle. INTERVENTION(S): The PGD analysis of embryos. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Patients were divided into two groups based on sperm morphology: teratospermic group (TSG) and normal sperm group (NSG). The primary outcome measures of rates of aneuploidy, implantation, clinical pregnancy rate (PR) per cycle, and clinical PR per embryo transfer were compared between TSG and NSG according to PGD analysis results. RESULTS: A higher percentage of normal embryos was seen in the NSG (32%) versus the TSG (20%). Overall, 30% of IVF-PGD cycles had no normal embryos for transfer. The clinical PR per cycle was 44% in the NSG compared to 14% in the TSG (relative risk [RR] = 3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-9.0). A similar trend was noted with the clinical PR per embryo transfer with 57% patients becoming pregnant in the NSG versus 20% patients in the TSG (RR = 2.76; 95% CI 1.2-7.2). Implantation was twice as likely to occur in the NSG as compared to TSG (RR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.1-7.2). CONCLUSION(S): Rates of euploidy, implantation, clinical PR per cycle, and clinical PR per embryo transfer were higher in the NSG compared to the TSG, suggesting that sperm morphology plays an important role in the outcome of IVF-PGD cycles.
