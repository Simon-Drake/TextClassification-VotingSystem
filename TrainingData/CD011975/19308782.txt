Parent's attitudes towards full-scale prenatal testing for genetic disorders.
OBJECTIVES: Innovations in the field of prenatal diagnostic testing have led to the development of molecular tests that allow the rapid detection of specific genetic defects, such as Down syndrome. In addition, full-scale tests have been developed allowing the detection of many genetic disorders in a single test. Here we examined the attitudes of pregnant women in low risk pregnancies towards full-scale genetic testing and explored relationships between demographic characteristics and the level of interest. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 115 consecutive pregnant women. They completed the same structured questionnaire at two different time points, before counselling (T1) and after 4 weeks (T2), to assess a possible change of attitude. RESULTS: At T1, 33% of the respondents were in favour of full-scale testing of their unborn child, whereas at T2, this percentage had dropped to 18%. Except for educational level, no significant relationships were noted between the demographic variables and the wish to opt for full-scale testing. A low educational level was significantly related to the interest in full-scale testing. CONCLUSIONS: Low risk pregnant women expressed little interest in full-scale genetic testing. Educational level appeared to affect their views.
