Do women prefer to have screening tests for Down syndrome that have the lowest screen-positive rate or the highest detection rate?
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether women have a preference for Down syndrome screening test performance. METHODS: A structured questionnaire exploring women's preferences for screening test performance was administered to women attending their first prenatal visit who wished to have Down syndrome screening performed. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty women were interviewed. The majority of women (n=80) chose a screening test with a low screen-positive rate rather than the highest detection rate. The reasons given for this preference were a desire to minimise the risk of miscarriage of a normal baby and a belief that a detection rate of 80 to 90% was acceptable. However, older women (>37 years) chose a test with the highest detection rate possible, regardless of the higher screen-positive rate, preferring to miscarry a normal baby as a result of a diagnostic test rather than miss the detection of a baby with Down syndrome. Preferences were not influenced by previous screening experience. CONCLUSIONS: Women express different preferences for screening test performance. Maternal age rather than previous screening experiences appears to be the major influence in these choices.
