Miscarriage after invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures: how much risk our pregnant women are willing to take?
OBJECTIVES: To elicit the level of risk of prenatal diagnostic procedure-related miscarriage that Chinese pregnant women were willing to accept. METHODS: An interviewer-administered survey was conducted on 276 women who presented to the University Obstetric Unit. Using the standard gamble approach, subjects were asked to choose between a screening test with a 90% detection rate and a diagnostic test which is definitive but carries a finite risk of abortion. This probability of abortion was varied until the subject was indifferent between the two choices, and the value was called the utility score. RESULTS: When compared with a screening test with 90% detection rate, the median utility score was 0.989 (IQR: 0.970-0.999). The median risk of abortion below which the subjects would rather opt for an invasive test instead of a screening test was 1.1%. The percentage of patients who could accept a procedure-related miscarriage risk of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2% were 76, 67, 59.8 and 38.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant Chinese women agreed to trade a definitive chromosomal diagnostic test from a highly effective screening test with a small risk of undiagnosed aneuploidy provided that the procedure-related miscarriage risk was 1.1% or lower.
