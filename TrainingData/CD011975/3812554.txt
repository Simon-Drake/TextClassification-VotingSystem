Mosaic trisomy 7 and renal dysplasia.
Trisomy 7 was detected in umbilical cord cells cultured from a fetus with renal dysplasia. Skin fibroblasts were diploid. Because of a paucity of liveborn infants with full trisomy 7, the phenotype is not well described; however renal anomalies appear to be common with trisomy 7.
