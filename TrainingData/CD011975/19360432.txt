Case report of fetal axillo-thoraco-abdominal cystic hygroma.
Cystic hygroma (moist tumor) was first described in 1828 by Redenbacher. The cyst usually results owing to an absence or an inefficient connection between the lymphatic and venous systems. Of this type of malformation 75% cases are localized in the nuchal region; however, only 20% are found in the axilla while 5% of these hygromas are in other locations. Prognosis depends on associated fetal co-morbidities. There are many case reports on cystic hygroma but only a few on the axillo-thoraco-abdominal variant. This is a case report of a huge late-onset fetal axillo-thoraco-abdominal cystic hygroma, which was diagnosed at term followed by a difficult vaginal delivery in a 38-year-old woman. The baby did not have any congenital anomaly other than cystic hygroma with no evidence of intrathoracic or intra-abdominal extension of mass and a pelvic kidney reported on neonatal ultrasound and CT scan. The surgical excision of the cyst was done on the fourth day following birth and the histopathology report confirmed the diagnosis. Management of fetal cystic hygroma with the use of a sclerosing agent is a new modality being explored. Risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies for aneuploidy is not increased. The baby has been followed up to 5 months of birth and is thriving well. Karyotype shows an XX pattern.
