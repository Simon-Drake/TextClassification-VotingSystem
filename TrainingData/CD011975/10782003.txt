Assessment of risk for chromosomal abnormalities at 10-14 weeks of gestation by nuchal translucency and maternal age in 5,210 fetuses at a single centre.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the screening of chromosomal abnormalities by nuchal translucency (NT) measurement. METHODS: Assessment of risk for chromosomal abnormalities by NT and maternal age in 5,210 single fetuses with karyotype and outcome already known. RESULTS: Risk was > or =1 in 300 in 640 (12.2%) of all fetuses, in 575 (11.1%) of the normal fetuses, in 38 (80.8%) of the fetuses affected by trisomy 21, and in 65 (89%) of the fetuses affected by chromosomal abnormalities. Risk was > or =1 in 200 in 477 (9.1%) of all fetuses, in 418 (8.1%) of the normal fetuses, in 35 (74.4%) of the fetuses affected by trisomy 21, and in 59 (80.8%) of the fetuses affected by chromosomal abnormalities. Risk was > or =1 in 100 in 270 (5.1%) of all fetuses, in 216 (4.2%) of the normal fetuses, in 33 (70.2%) of the fetuses affected by trisomy 21, and in 54 (73.9%) of the fetuses affected by chromosomal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Risk generated by NT and maternal age is effective in screening for chromosomal abnormalities.
