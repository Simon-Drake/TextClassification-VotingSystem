Ultrasonography in the detection of aneuploidy in the first trimester.
Ultrasonography has been used increasingly in the first trimester to identify fetal anomalies as early as possible in gestation. First trimester sonographic screening may detect a greater proportion of aneuploid fetuses than sonography performed later in pregnancy, and it may allow determination of potential markers for prediction of chromosomal anomalies.
