Rapid prenatal diagnosis of common chromosome aneuploidies by QF-PCR, results of 9 years of clinical experience.
BACKGROUND: Despite being deliberately targeted to common chromosome aneuploidies, the rapid quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) tests can detect the majority of chromosome abnormalities in prenatal diagnosis. The main advantages of this assay are low cost, speed and automation allowing large-scale application. METHODS: We developed a QF-PCR test that was applied on 43 000 clinical samples reporting results in 24 h. Most common indications were biochemical risk (32%) and advanced maternal age (30%). Samples were also tested by cytogenetic analysis and the results compared. RESULTS: Aneuploidies involving chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y were detected with 100% specificity. Several cases of partial trisomies and mosaicism were also identified. Overall 95% of clinically relevant abnormalities were readily detected and termination of affected pregnancies could be performed without waiting for the cytogenetic results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the possibility of reducing the load of prenatal cytogenetic tests if the pregnancies are carefully monitored by non-invasive screening. In case of abnormal QF-PCR results, medical action can be taken within few hours from sampling. In cases of negative QF-PCR results, cytogenetic analyses might only be performed for fetuses with ultrasound abnormalities. In countries where large-scale cytogenetic tests are not available, QF-PCR may be used as the only prenatal diagnostic procedure.
