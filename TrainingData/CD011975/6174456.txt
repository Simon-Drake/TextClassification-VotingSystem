Alpha-fetoprotein and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in amniotic fluid.
A series of data on amniotic fluid levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) are presented. Both hormones were observed to decrease with advancing gestational age. The diagnostic importance of AFP levels is confirmed, and the very high levels of beta-HCG in twin gestations are documented. A statistically significant correlation between the concentration of both hormones is demonstrated.
