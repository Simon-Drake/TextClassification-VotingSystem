A clinicopathologic study of vagina and cervix in DES-exposed progeny.
In this survey of 210 women with a history and/or gross changes of the cervix and vagina characteristic of DES exposure, changes related to vaginal adenosis were correlated with age. The mean age of women with columnar epithelium alone was 18.5 +/- 3.2 years, columnar epithelium with squamous metaplasia was 20.2 +/- 3.4 years, and squamous metaplasia alone was 23.0 +/- 2.7 years. These findings suggest that involution of vaginal adenosis occurs with increasing age. Involution of glands in the superficial stroma in most cases occurred concurrently with that of surface columnar epithelium. However, those deeply seated and complex glands in the stroma might lag in the metaplastic process and might persist. The pitfalls of misinterpretation of squamous cell changes in histologic samples were discussed. The lack of correlation between the colposcopic findings of mosaicism and/or punctuation and squamous cell neoplasia was confirmed in this study.
