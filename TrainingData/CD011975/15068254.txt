Heart type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) is decreased in brains of patients with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.
Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are thought to play a role in the binding, targeting and transport of long-chain fatty acids, and at least three types of FABPs are found in human brain; heart type (H)-FABP, brain type (B)-FABP and epidermal type (E)-FABP. Although all three FABPs could be involved in normal brain function in prenatal and postnatal life, a neurobiological role of FABPs in neurodegenerative diseases has not been reported yet. These made us evaluate the protein levels of FABPs in brains from patients with Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and fetal cerebral cortex with DS using two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis with subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS) identification and specific software for quantification of proteins. In adult brain, B-FABP was significantly increased in occipital cortex of DS, and H-FABP was significantly decreased in DS (frontal, occipital and parietal cortices) and AD (frontal, temporal, occipital and parietal cortices). In fetal brain, B-FABP and epidermal E-FABP levels were comparable in controls and DS. We conclude that aberrant expression of FABPs, especially H-FABP may alter membrane fluidity and signal transduction, and consequently could be involved in cellular dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders.
