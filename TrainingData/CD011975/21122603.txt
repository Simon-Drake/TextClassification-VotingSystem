Effect of first-trimester ultrasound screening for Down syndrome on maternal-fetal attachment--a randomized controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate how ultrasound screening for Down syndrome (DS) in the first trimester, compared with a routine ultrasound examination in the second trimester, affected Maternal-Fetal Attachment (MFA) in mid-pregnancy. METHOD: This study of 2026 pregnant women was a sub-study of a larger RCT aiming at evaluating the effect of fetal screening for Down syndrome (DS) by means of an ultrasound scan, including measuring fetal nuchal translucency in gestational weeks 12-14. Women were randomly allocated either to the intervention or to a control group where routine care with an ultrasound scan in gestational week 17-20 was offered. Data were collected by questionnaires before randomization and in gestational week 24. MFA was measured by a modified version of the Cranley Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale (CMFAS). RESULTS: The mean score of MFA was 3.50 in the intervention group and 3.44 in the control group (p=0.04). The mean scores on all subscales were slightly higher in the intervention group, but only statistically significant regarding "Differentiation of self from fetus" (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound screening for DS in the first trimester may have a modest positive effect on MFA in mid-pregnancy, compared with a ultrasound scan in the second trimester.
