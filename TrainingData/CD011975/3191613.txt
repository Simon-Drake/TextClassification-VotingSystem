Sperm chromosome analysis to assess potential germ cell mosaicism.
Human sperm chromosome complements were examined to assess the possibility that the conceptions of two children with the same chromosomal defect, del(13)(q22q32), from chromosomally normal parents were the result of a paternal germ cell mosaicism. Analysis of 216 complements, both by quinacrine banding and by measuring the relative length of chromosome 13, showed no unusual subpopulation of 13s; this decreased the likelihood of a paternal origin of the deletion. Sperm chromosomal analysis is a useful adjunct to available techniques in clinical genetics. When counseling cases involving either structural or numerical de novo chromosome abnormality, it is of importance to discuss the possibility of germ cell line mosaicism as well as to offer prenatal diagnosis for subsequent pregnancies.
