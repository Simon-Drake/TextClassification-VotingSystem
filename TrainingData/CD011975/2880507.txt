Prenatal detection of intestinal obstructions, aneuploidy syndromes, and cystic fibrosis by microvillar enzyme assays (disaccharidases, alkaline phosphatase, and glutamyltransferase) in amniotic fluid.
Microvillar enzymes (disaccharidases, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase) were assayed in amniotic fluid from pregnancies with normal and abnormal fetuses to determine their specificity and reliability for the prenatal detection of intestinal obstructions and cystic fibrosis. All fetuses with imperforate anus, duodenal atresia, jejuno-ileal atresia, multiple intestinal atresia, or other forms of intestinal obstructions, with or without associated ventral wall defect or aneuploidy syndrome, showed diminished microvillar enzyme activities below the normal range of control amniotic fluid samples. The exclusively intestinal hydrolases maltase, sucrase, palatinase, and alkaline phosphatase were the most reliable and sensitive markers to detect intestinal obstructions whereas more widely distributed trehalase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities were less sensitive. The combination of intestinal disaccharidase maltase, sucrase or palatinase and ALP assays is more accurate for prenatal diagnosis of CF than a combination of intestinal ALP and GGTF assays.
