Prospectively randomized controlled trial of PGS in IVF/ICSI patients with poor implantation.
This randomized, controlled trial verifies whether patients with recurrent failed implantation benefit from preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy, as compared with conventional assisted reproduction treatment procedures. Two hundred patients with recurrent failed implantation were randomized into two groups. A total of 139 patients underwent ovarian stimulation, and preimplantation genetic screening was performed in 72 patients. Analysis of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 16, 18, 21 and 22 was carried out using fluorescence in-situ hybridization in blastomeres of day-3 cleavage-stage embryos in the study group. The primary endpoint was implantation rate. Secondary endpoints were embryonic morphology and chromosomal status, number of transferred embryos and clinical pregnancy rate. With regard to the implantation rate, there was no significant difference between the study group (21.4%) and the control group (25.3%). The number of embryos transferred was significantly lower in the study group, namely 1.4 (SD 1.0) versus 2.1 (SD 1.0) in the control group (P < 0.05). The clinical pregnancy rate was not significantly different between the groups (25.0% in the study group versus 40.3% in the control group). It can be concluded that preimplantation genetic screening does not increase the implantation rates after IVF-intracytoplasmic sperm injection in women with repeated implantation failure.
