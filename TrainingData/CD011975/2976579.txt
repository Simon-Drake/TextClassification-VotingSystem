Selective termination of multiple gestations.
Twenty-two selective terminations in multiple gestations were performed by a number of different methods. In 17 dichorionic pregnancies there was a successful delivery in surviving singletons or twins. In five monochorionic pregnancies undergoing selective termination there was a successful delivery in only one and a pregnancy loss in the other four. Six of the 18 delivered pregnancies were complicated by premature labor and delivery. Among the several methods used for selective termination, intracardiac potassium chloride injection appears to be the procedure of choice in dichorionic pregnancies.
