Does PGD for aneuploidy screening change the selection of embryos derived from testicular sperm extraction in obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermic men?
BACKGROUND: An increased incidence of aneuploid embryos has been recently described from azoospermic men. The aim of this study was to assess if embryo selection on day 5, based on morphological criteria, would be different from the selection based on PGD for aneuploidy screening (AS) in couples undergoing ICSI for male azoospermia. METHODS: Sixty-two cycles of testicular sperm extraction (TESE)-ICSI with PGD-AS were included in the analysis. Two embryologists, blinded to the PGD-AS results, retrospectively reviewed the available embryology data from day 5 embryos and selected one, two or three embryos to be transferred. These results were compared with the selected embryos based on PGD-AS. RESULTS: A total of 39 cycles from non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and 23 cycles from obstructive azoospermia (OA) were retrospectively analysed. If single embryo transfer (SET) had been performed, in 64.8% of the NOA cycles and 54.5% of the OA cycles, no difference in embryo choice would have occurred compared to PGD-AS and in 10.8 and 36.6% of the cycles, respectively, an aneuploid embryo would have been chosen. If double ET (DET) had been performed, in 72.9% of the NOA cycles and 86.5% of the OA cycles, no difference in embryo choice would have occurred compared to PGD-AS and in 2.7 and 4.5% of the cycles, respectively, an aneuploid embryo would have been chosen. If triple ET (TET) had been performed, the outcome would have been the same as for DET. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that under the terms of an SET policy, the performance of PGD-AS in azoospermia would result in a higher chance of success, as the possibility of selecting a euploid embryo is enhanced.
