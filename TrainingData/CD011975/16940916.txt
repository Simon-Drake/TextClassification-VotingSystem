[Autopsy findings related to Down's syndrome: 101 cases].
OBJECTIVES: To analyze the spectrum of congenital malformations among fetuses with Down's syndrome sent for necropsy. Materials and methods. Necropsies following medical termination of pregnancy during the second and third trimester were performed during a 4 year period. RESULTS: The incidence of each malformation was determined. Talipes equinovarus and aberrant lobation of the lung were present in 6% of cases. We are able to state precisely the incidence of 11 pairs of ribs: 11%. CONCLUSION: A precise knowledge about Down's syndrome associated malformations is essential for genetic counselling. The exact incidence of each sign is important to lead ultrasound examination when this syndrome is revealed.
