Intrachromosomal triplications: molecular cytogenetic and clinical studies.
A newborn boy had meconium aspiration syndrome, hypospadias, a supernumerary digit on the left hand, hyperbilirubinemia, a fractured right clavicle, osteopenia, liver calcification, and mild pulmonary hyperplasia. Cytogenetic studies showed a chromosome 13 with additional material in 33% of the metaphases. The add(13) was considered to be a probable duplication of 13q12q22. The 13 paint probe hybridized to the add(13) from end to end. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using retinoblastoma probe (RB)-1 that maps to 13q14 and D13S585 that maps to 13q32-q33 gave one signal for RB and three signals for D13S585. The pattern of the three signals from the 13q32q33 region and the G-banding pattern was best explained as a triplication of 13q22q33, with an inverted middle repeat resulting in tetrasomy for this segment. Mosaicism was confirmed by FISH using a D13S585 probe on a buccal smear. Three triplications detected in our laboratory were compared 13q22q33, 15q11q13, and 2q11.2q21. FISH was critical in identifying triplications 13q22q33 and 15q11q13. The hybridization pattern also indicated an inverted middle repeat. We conclude that intrachromosomal triplications may be more prevalent than previously assumed and they probably share a common mechanism in their formation. When the G-bands do not correspond exactly to a duplication or to a tandem triplication, an important consideration is that the majority of triplications have an inverted middle repeat. Triplications can be mistaken for duplications. Therefore, in assessing duplications, FISH confirmation is recommended.
