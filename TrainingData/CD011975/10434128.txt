Biparental expression of IGFBP1 and IGFBP3 renders their involvement in the etiology of Silver-Russell syndrome unlikely.
Maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 7 has recently been reported in about 10% of Silver-Russell (SRS) patients. It can therefore be concluded that at least one gene on chromosome 7 is imprinted and mutations in this gene/these genes might contribute to the phenotype of the disease. Two genes which are involved in growth and localised in 7p12-13 are the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins 1 and 3 (IGFBP1; IGFBP3). Comparison to the mouse genome shows that the syntenic region on mouse chromosome 11 is imprinted, UPD of this region leads to deviations in growth in mice. In the present study we investigated whether the genes for IGFBP1 and IGFBP3 might be involved in the etiology of SRS: after exclusion of SRS specific mutations we could demonstrate biparental expression of both genes in lymphocytes of an SRS patient without UPD7 as well as expression in a patient with maternal UPD7. Our results as well as those from other groups show biparental expression of IGFBP1 in fetal tissues and expression of IGFBP3 in nearly every tissue during puberty and adult life. Thus, no evidence is given for an involvement of the two genes in SRS.
