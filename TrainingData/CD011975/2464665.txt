[Alpha-fetoprotein and trisomy 21].
In 31 affected pregnancies with Down syndrome, the median maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein value was lower than normal, 0.76 MoM, and median amniotic fluid value was quite normal, 0.98 MoM. Selecting an arbitrary cutoff-point of 0.5 MoM, 4.1 percent of normal gestations show values less than 0.5 MoM. Authors discuss problems about screening for fetal Down's syndrome by measuring maternal serum AFP levels.
