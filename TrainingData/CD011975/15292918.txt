Strategies for the rapid prenatal diagnosis of chromosome aneuploidy.
Rapid diagnosis of common chromosome aneuploidies in raised risk pregnancies, usually prior to full karyotype analysis, is now carried out in a number of European genetic centres; several techniques for detecting genomic copy number changes have been described. Prenatal diagnosis of genetic disease requires accurate and robust assays; the invasive procedures are associated with a risk of pregnancy loss and an abnormal result may lead to termination of the pregnancy. The testing of prenatal material (amniotic fluid, chorionic villi or, more rarely, fetal blood) is associated with specific problems, including the quality and quantity of the tissue and difficulties of interpretation due to phenomena such as maternal cell contamination and mosaicism. In addition, there are 24-h, high-throughput demands on centres offering such a service. The extent to which existing and proposed strategies, including different PCR-based assays, a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification approach, and microarrays, fulfil the requirements of rapid prenatal testing is discussed. In the past 3 years, we have tested 7720 prenatal samples for trisomies 13, 18 and 21 using a quantitative fluorescence-PCR (QF-PCR) approach. The abnormality rate was 5.7%. There were no misdiagnoses for nonmosaic trisomy, the amplification failure rate was 0.09% of samples, and 97% of samples received a report on the working day following sample receipt. Maternal cell contamination and mosaicism were also detected. Our data recommend a QF-PCR approach as the current method of choice for rapid aneuploidy testing.
