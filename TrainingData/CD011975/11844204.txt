Relationship between nuchal translucency at 11-14 weeks and nuchal fold at 20-24 weeks of gestation.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between the measurement of nuchal translucency in the first trimester and nuchal fold in the second trimester in normal pregnancy. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 592 singleton pregnancies. Fetal nuchal translucency was measured at 11-14 weeks of gestation and nuchal fold at 20-24 weeks of gestation. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between nuchal translucency and nuchal fold after adjustment for gestational age. RESULTS: There was no significant association between nuchal translucency and nuchal fold thickness. CONCLUSION: It is possible that measurement of nuchal translucency and nuchal fold may provide an independent contribution in screening for trisomy 21.
