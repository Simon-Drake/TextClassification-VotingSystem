The diagnostic potential of fetal renal biopsy.
The feasibility of fetal renal biopsy has been investigated in order to assess the diagnostic value of the histological specimen. Two fetuses with a severe bilateral renal abnormality (multicystic dysplastic kidney, Meckel-Gruber syndrome with polycystic kidney) and one fetus with Down syndrome (no detectable structural anomaly) were sampled. Histological findings in the biopsy specimens of cases 1 and 2 were diagnostic of an early obstructive renal disease. In case 3, the findings were consistent with normal development for gestational age of the kidney. Fetal renal biopsy is technically feasible; histological examination of the samples showed a good correlation with postnatal findings. Further studies of its diagnostic value are required.
