Paternal meiotic origin of der(21;21)(q10;q10) mosaicism [46,XX/46, XX,der(21;21)(q10;q10),+21] in a girl with mild Down syndrome.
Mosaicism for a derivative 21, der(21;21)(q10;q10), is a rare chromosomal abnormality. Since a normal cell line is present, mitotic origin is considered. Chromosome examination of a female with developmental delay and dysmorphic features compatible with mosaic trisomy 21 revealed a normal cell line and a second cell line with a der(21;21)(q10;q10) [46,XX/46,XX,der(21;21)(q10;q10),+21]. Molecular investigation with a panel of highly polymorphic microsatellites mapping to chromosome 21 demonstrated three different alleles, two of paternal and one of maternal origin. Therefore, either formation of the der(21;21)(q10;q10) during paternal meiosis with subsequent loss of the der(21;21)(q10;q10) and mitotic reduplication of the maternal homologue in the normal cell line, or more likely a zygote with paternally derived trisomy 21 and subsequent mitotic formation of the der(21;21)(q10;q10) have to be considered. This case again shows that mammalian chromosome aberrations may have a more complex mechanism of formation than was previously thought.
