Assessment of fetal status in multiple gestation pregnancies using interphase FISH.
The use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for women with multiple gestation pregnancies has been evaluated. Women were referred for chromosome analysis because of advanced maternal age, abnormal ultrasound findings or a positive family history and/or prior to fetal reduction. FISH was successfully applied to all specimens obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Based on FISH results, fetal-fetal contamination of specimens following CVS was 11.5% in twin pregnancies and 16% in triplet or higher multiples. FISH detected trisomy 21 in three cases with no false negatives or positives. Whereas FISH may provide rapid and useful assessment of fetal status in decision-making regarding fetal reduction, the present study also highlighted the obstetrical difficulty of ensuring a sample representative of each fetus following CVS in addition to the possibility of not identifying clinically significant chromosome aberrations using currently available FISH probes.
