Meiotic origin of trisomy in neoplasms: evidence in a case of erythroleukaemia.
Trisomic cells in neoplasms may represent abnormal clones originated from a tissue-confined mosaicism, and arise therefore by a meiotic error. We report on a 16-month-old child with erythroleukaemia (AML-M6), whose marrow karyotype at onset was 48,XX,del(13)(q12q14),del(14)(q22q32),+21,+21. The parental origin of the supernumerary chromosomes 21 was investigated by comparing 10 polymorphic loci scattered along the whole chromosome on the patient's marrow and her parents' leukocytes. Three loci were informative for the presence of three alleles, two of which were of maternal origin; two further loci showed a maternal allele of higher intensity. Lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts showed a normal karyotype, and molecular analysis on leukocytes at remission, buccal smear and urinary sediment cells consistently showed only one maternal allele, whereas neonatal blood from Guthrie spot showed two maternal alleles as in the marrow. An accurate clinical re-evaluation confirmed a normal phenotype. Our results indicate that tetrasomy 21 arose from a marrow clone with trisomy 21 of meiotic origin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence that supernumerary chromosomes in neoplastic clones may in fact be present due to a meiotic error. This demonstrates that a tissue-confined constitutional mosaicism for a trisomy may indeed represent the first event in multistep carcinogenesis.
