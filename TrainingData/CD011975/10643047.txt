[The characteristics of the distribution of HLA antigens in the families of children with aneuploid chromosomal pathology].
Search of possible immunogenetic markers of tendency to form aneuploid offspring was carried out. We have studied HLA-antigens distribution among families with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome children and among families with miscarriages. The disposition to reproduction of affected offspring is associated with following HLA-antigens: B40, B41 and B51. The most typical haplotypes among families with affected offspring were: A2B27, A2B40, A2B51, A9B51, A10B8, A10B40. The HLA-antigens distribution among families with miscarriages supports evidence, that certain haplotypes can contribute to aneuploidy in progeny.
