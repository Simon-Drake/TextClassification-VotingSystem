Second trimester total human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein and unconjugated estriol in predicting pregnancy complications other than fetal aneuploidy.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), total human chorionic gonadotropin (ThCG) and unconjugated estriol in predicting certain complications of pregnancy other than fetal aneuploidy. STUDY DESIGN: Among 2384 women that underwent biochemical screening between 15 and 22 weeks of gestation, pregnancy outcome was evaluated in 677 women under 35 years of age according to serum marker levels by using cut-off points discriminative for Down syndrome or neural tube defect (NTD). RESULTS: High alpha-fetoprotein levels (MoM>/=2.0) were found to be significantly more frequent (P<0.05) in cases of fetal growth restriction (odds ratio=2.7), miscarriage (odds ratio=4.4) and intrauterine fetal death (odds ratio=5.8). High chorionic gonadotropin levels (MoM>/=2.02) were associated with intrauterine growth restriction (odds ratio=2.1; P<0.05), miscarriage (odds ratio=4; P<0.01), preterm birth (odds ratio=2.5; P<0.05), and intrauterine fetal death (odds ratio=4.2; P<0.01). Among pregnancies with intrauterine growth restriction and threatening preterm delivery, low unconjugated estriol levels (MoM</=0.74) were significantly more frequent (odds ratio=2.2; P<0.05 and odds ratio=2.6; P<0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: All three markers predictive for fetal trisomy 21 shown to be associated with various pregnancy complications in euploid pregnancies.
