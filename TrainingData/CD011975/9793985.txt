Low-level mosaicism for both trisomy 15 and monosomy-X in amniotic fluid cells confirmed in fetal tissues.
We report here a case of true fetal mosaicism for both trisomy 15 and monosomy-X; the aberrant cell lines were initially detected at amniocentesis as low-level mosaicism (trisomy 15) and multiple-cell pseudo-mosaicism (monosomy-X). In the fetal lymphocytes, only metaphases with a normal chromosome complement were observed. After termination of the pregnancy, various fetal biopsies revealed both trisomy 15 and monosomy-X mosaicism, whereas, at autopsy, no external or internal abnormalities could be detected in the fetus. The karyotype can be described as 45,X[15]/47,XY,+15[3]/46,XY[27]. Our results implicate that an additional amniocentesis could be more helpful than fetal blood sampling in predicting the fetal karyotype after diagnosis of chromosome mosaicism at amniocentesis.
