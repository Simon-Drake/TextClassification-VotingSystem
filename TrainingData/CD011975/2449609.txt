[What should the pediatrician know about prenatal AFP diagnosis?].
Alphafetoprotein (AFP) represents an embryo-fetal glycoprotein. The fetus it enters amnion fluid and maternal serum. Increased concentrations are observed in these fluids in the presence of certain fetal malformations, e.g. neural tube defects and anterior abdominal wall defects or omphalocele, and in congenital nephrosis of the Finnish type. An increased concentration also signals general risks as an increased tendency to abortion or to low birth weight infants. Very low maternal serum AFP indicates an increased risk for trisomy 21. Postnatally increased AFP-concentration has been described in ataxia-teleangiectasia (Louis-Bar-Syndrome) and in severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. Although the AFP-determination is mainly used for obstetric prenatal care and diagnosis it also has an importance for the pediatrician as an early indicator of special risks.
