[The third sentence of the Supreme Tribunal on "wrongful birth" cases. My attempt to reconcile its doctrine with that of the 2 previous sentences].
The High Court has pronounced three sentences about cases called "wrongful birth". In the first sentence the High Court estimated the mother's legal action. In the second sentence it rejected the legal action of the parents, with regard to some specific arguments. In the third sentence the High Court has also rejected the legal action of the parents but in relation to another different arguments. This article tries to find a reason for these apparent "jurisprudencial contradiction".
