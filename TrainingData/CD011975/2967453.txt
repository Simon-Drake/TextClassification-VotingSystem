Spontaneous resolution of fetal cystic hygroma in Down's syndrome.
We describe a case of spontaneous resolution of a cystic hygroma between 14-16 weeks' gestation in a fetus with trisomy 21 who, at termination at 19 weeks, revealed only mild webbing of the neck. Redundant nuchal skin folds are among the most common features of trisomy 21. Our case supports the hypothesis that this redundant skin of the fetal neck represents early cystic hygromas, which resolve in utero before 16 weeks' gestation.
