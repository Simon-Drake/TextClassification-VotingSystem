[Rapid prenatal diagnosis of chromosome aneuploidies in 60 uncultured amniotic fluid samples by fluorescence in situ hybridization].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of rapid prenatal diagnosis of chromosome aneuploidies by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using uncultured amniotic fluid. METHODS: Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA probes were prepared and validated by using cultured peripheral blood. Interphase FISH for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y was performed in 60 amniotic fluid samples for the rapid prenatal diagnosis of chromosome aneuploidies, and the results were compared with the karyotypes from conventional cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Of all 60 cases, 58 were concordant with their karyotypes, and 1 case of inv(9) and another case of t(2,12) were identified by karyotyping. Two cases of trisomy 21 and 1 case of trisomy 18 were detected by FISH and confirmed with conventional cytogenetics (sensitivity=100%). There were no false-positive or false-negative results. CONCLUSION: This evaluation demonstrated that FISH employing BAC DNA probes could accurately and rapidly detect aneuploidies involving the above 5 chromosomes. However, as it does not identify structural chromosome aberrations and aneuploidies involving other chromosomes, it is not a substitute for conventional chromosome analysis, and the negative FISH result should be carefully interpreted.
