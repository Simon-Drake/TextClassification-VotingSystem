Prenatal diagnosis of complete atrioventricular septal defect with truncus arteriosus.
Truncus arteriosus (TA) is a rare cardiac anomaly constituting less than 1% of all congenital heart defects. Its association with complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) is extremely unusual and only 12 cases diagnosed postnatally or postmortem have been reported so far. We describe the first case of truncus arteriosus with AVSD to be diagnosed prenatally by fetal echocardiography.
