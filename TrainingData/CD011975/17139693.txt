ADAM12-s in coelomic fluid and maternal serum in early pregnancy.
OBJECTIVES: ADAM12-s is a placental protein. In early pregnancy, reduced maternal levels of ADAM12-s have been reported in association with foetal trisomy 21 or 18 and in cases that subsequently develop pre-eclampsia and foetal growth restriction. The aim of this study is to investigate the distribution of ADAM12-s in early pregnancy by comparing its concentration in maternal serum, amniotic fluid and coelomic fluid. METHODS: Coelomic fluid was obtained by coelocentesis from 13 singleton pregnancies with live foetuses at 6.9-9.3 weeks of gestation. Maternal serum was also obtained in all cases and in six cases amniotic fluid was also obtained. The concentration of ADAM12-s was measured by dissociation enhanced lanthanide fluoro-immunoassay. RESULTS: The median concentration of ADAM12-s in maternal serum was 132.7 (range 33.8-254.5) ng/mL and in coelomic fluid it was 10.5 (range 1.3-15.8) ng/mL; there were no detectable levels in five of the six amniotic fluid samples. The concentration of maternal serum ADAM12-s increased significantly with gestation (r = 0.862, p < 0.0001). There was no significant association between coelomic fluid ADAM12-s and either gestation (r = 0.255, p = 0.401) or maternal serum ADAM12-s (r = 0.302, p = 0.316). CONCLUSION: The distribution of ADAM12-s in maternal serum and the early embryonic fluid compartments is consistent with its syncytiotrophoblastic origin.
