First-trimester ultrasound: current uses and applications.
This article is aimed to aid the sonographer and medical care provider in better interpretation and clinical application of first-trimester ultrasound findings in early pregnancy. We review current uses, applications, and interpretations of first-trimester ultrasound. A discussion of basic embryology and normal as well as abnormal first-trimester sonographic findings are discussed. We also cover the utility of the first-trimester ultrasound in screening for fetal aneuploidy. Attention is also given to the role of the first-trimester ultrasound in the prediction of adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes.
