Major fetal abnormalities associated with positive screening tests for Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS).
OBJECTIVE: Determine the relationship between positive screening interpretations for Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and other fetal abnormalities, to aid counseling and diagnostic activities. METHODS: An SLOS screening algorithm was incorporated into California's second-trimester screening program for Down syndrome and open neural tube defects (ONTDs). Between 2002 and 2004, 777 088 pregnant women were given an SLOS risk interpretation, using alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) measurements. Outcomes were obtained in 98.8% of screen-positive pregnancies. RESULTS: SLOS screen positives, alone or in combination with screen positives for other fetal disorders (Down syndrome, trisomy 18, ONTD), were associated with a high risk for fetal pathology. Type and frequency of chromosomal or anatomic abnormalities (or fetal death) varied according to screen-positive combination. Among 2018 screen-positive pregnancies, 644 fetal deaths were identified. Among the 1374 viable pregnancies, 519 were screen positive for SLOS alone; two SLOS cases and 51 other serious abnormalities were identified (14 aneuploidies; 37 anatomic). The remaining 855 were also screen positive for at least one other disorder; two SLOS cases and 327 other abnormalities were identified (180 aneuploidies; 157 anatomic). CONCLUSION: For screening programs implementing the SLOS algorithm, the present data may be useful for counseling and to guide diagnostic studies.
