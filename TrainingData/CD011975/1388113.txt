Comparison of assay kits for unconjugated estriol shows that expressing results as multiples of the median causes unacceptable variation in calculated risk factors for Down syndrome.
We compared the performance of two methods for assaying unconjugated estriol in serum: the modified Amerlex third-trimester RIA kit, as used in seminal papers on unconjugated estriol in Down syndrome screening, and the new optimized Amerlex-M second-trimester kit. The significant difference between the results of each assay could cause unacceptable changes in the detection rate and false-positive rate of Down syndrome screening programs, especially if previously published values for estriol are used in the risk calculation. It is not possible to define new calculation parameters for every assay kit because new parameters will need to be defined every time kit changes occur, which would require a large collection of samples from Down syndrome pregnancies for standardization. Possible solutions to this problem are discussed.
