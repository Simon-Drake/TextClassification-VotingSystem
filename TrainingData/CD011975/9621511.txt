Age-specific incidences of chromosome abnormalities at the second trimester amniocentesis for Japanese mothers aged 35 and older: collaborative study of 5484 cases.
The aim of this study was to calculate the expected incidences of chromosome abnormalities found at amniocentesis in Japanese women aged 35 and older. From four clinics in Japan, we gathered genetic amniocentesis data on 5484 pregnant women at risk only due to their advanced age, 35 years and older. We analyzed the data using the logistic regression model. Of the 5484 fetuses, 117 (2.1%) were diagnosed with a chromosome abnormality. The abnormal karyotypes included 42 cases of trisomy 21; 13 of trisomy 18; 7 of trisomy 13; 10 of 47,XXY; 4 of 47,XXX; 1 of 47,XYY; 27 with various structural aberrations; and 13 with various types of mosaicism. The incidences of trisomy 21, lethal autosomal aneuploidies (trisomy 18 and trisomy 13), and sex-chromosome abnormalities (XXY, XXX, XYY) increased with maternal age. Parameters of the regression equations with their standard errors were calculated and the expected incidences of chromosome abnormalities at each maternal age were derived. The expected incidences of chromosome abnormalities obtained in this study are the first data published for Japan and will be useful for the counseling of pregnant women. The incidence of trisomy 21 is not different from the rates published previously for Western countries. The incidences of chromosome abnormalities are not affected by race or by geographic factors.
