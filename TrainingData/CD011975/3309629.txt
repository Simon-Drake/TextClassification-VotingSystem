[Cystic hygroma of the neck and non-immunologic hydrops fetalis].
Fetal cystic hygromas are a manifestation of early lymphatic obstruction. They are mostly associated with nonimmune hydrops fetalis. They often occur in a number of chromosome abnormalities (Turner syndrome and Down syndrome). We report on a prenatally detected case with nuchal cystic hygroma and nonimmune hydrops fetalis without chromosome aberration and without further major malformations. Postnatally hygroma and hydrops regressed.
