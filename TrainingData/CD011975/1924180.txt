Mosaic trisomy 17 in amniotic fluid cells not confirmed in the newborn.
A case of true fetal mosaicism 46,XY/47,XY, + 17 was diagnosed in amniotic fluid cells. After genetic counselling and unsuccessful periumbilical blood sampling the pregnancy continued to term, and a healthy male infant was born. Lymphocytes of the newborn had a normal karyotype. Follow-up of the child at age 18 months showed normal physical and mental development indicating that the trisomic cell line was restricted most probably to the extra fetal tissue.
