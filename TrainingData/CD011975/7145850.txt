Trisomy 20 mosaicism in amniotic fluid cells.
The significance of trisomy 20 mosaicism in cultured amniotic fluid cells is still confusing. We report a case of amniotic cell normal/trisomy 20 mosaicism diagnosed prenatally. The pregnancy was carried to term and a normal baby girl was delivered. The authors consider that in cases of amniotic fluid cell normal/trisomy 20 mosaicism the termination of pregnancy may not be advised, however, the parents should be fully informed.
