Preimplantation diagnosis for aneuploidies in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization with a poor prognosis: identification of the categories for which it should be proposed.
OBJECTIVE: To verify whether advantages can derive from the implementation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy in patients with a poor prognosis of full-term pregnancy, compared with conventional treatment procedures. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Reproductive Medicine Unit of the Societa Italiana Studi Medicina della Riproduzione, Bologna, Italy. PATIENT(S): In a total of 262 stimulated cycles, women presented with the following poor-prognosis indications: maternal age of > or =36 years (n = 157), > or =3 previous IVF failures (n = 54), and an altered karyotype (n = 51). After giving consent, 127 patients underwent preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy, whereas 135 controls underwent assisted zona hatching. INTERVENTION(S): Analysis of chromosomes XY, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, and 22 was carried out with the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique in a blastomere biopsied from day 3 embryos. Assisted zona hatching was performed on day 3 embryos from the control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryo morphology and chromosomal status, number of transferred embryos, clinical pregnancies, implantation rates, and abortions. RESULT(S): In the study group, 717 embryos were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and 60% were chromosomally abnormal. A mean of 2.3+/-0.9 euploid embryos were transferred in 99 cycles, resulting in 37 clinical pregnancies (37%) and a 22.5% ongoing implantation rate. In the control group, 126 cycles were performed with 3.2+/-1.3 embryos transferred, yielding 34 clinical pregnancies (27%) and a 10.2% ongoing implantation rate. CONCLUSION(S): The advantage of selecting embryos with a normal chromosome complement has an immediate impact on the ongoing implantation rate, especially in patients aged > or =38 years and carriers of an altered karyotype.
