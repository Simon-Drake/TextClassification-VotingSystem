Tetrasomy of the short arm of chromosome 9: prenatal diagnosis and further delineation of the phenotype.
A fetus with multiple malformations was identified by prenatal ultrasound investigation. Cordocentesis and fetal lymphocyte chromosome analysis demonstrated a model number of 47 chromosomes. The extra chromosome material was identified as an isochromosome of the entire short arm of chromosome 9 with no involvement of the heterochromatic region of the long arm [47,XY, + i(9p)]. This represents the first report of prenatal diagnosis of tetrasomy 9p. Further delineation of the phenotype is discussed.
