Prenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome in the presence of isolated Ebstein's anomaly.
Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital cardiac defect, characterized by the displacement of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, that occurs approximately once in 20,000 live births. The association of Ebstein's anomaly and chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down's syndrome, is extremely unusual. Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 in a fetus with isolated Ebstein's anomaly has not been previously reported.
