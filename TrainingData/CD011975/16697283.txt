Chromosomal variation in mammalian neuronal cells: known facts and attractive hypotheses.
Chromosomal mosaicism is still a genetic enigma. Although the mechanisms and consequences of this phenomenon have been studied for over 50 years, there are a number of gaps in our knowledge concerning causes, genetic mechanisms, and phenotypic manifestations of chromosomal mosaicism. Neuronal cell-specific chromosomal mosaicism is not an exception. Originally, neuronal cells of the mammalian brain were assumed to possess identical genomes. However, recent studies have shown chromosomal variations, manifested as chromosome abnormalities in cells of the developing and adult mammalian nervous system. Here, we review data obtained on the variation in chromosome complement in mammalian neuronal cells and hypothesize about the possible relevance of large-scale genomic (i.e., chromosomal) variations to brain development and functions as well as neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We propose to cover the term "molecular neurocytogenetics to cover all studies the aim of which is to reveal chromosome variations and organization in the mammalian brain.
