Prognostic role of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy in assisted reproductive technology outcome.
BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for aneuploidy is recommended to couples at risk of generating chromosomally abnormal embryos. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that PGD for aneuploidy has an important role in the prognosis of subsequent treatments. METHODS: A total of 389 couples underwent their first PGD for aneuploidy due to either female age >or=38 years (n = 266) or >or=3 previous unsuccessful cycles (n = 123). After the first PGD followed by an unsuccessful treatment cycle, 141 couples underwent 175 subsequent PGD cycles. These patients were divided into three groups depending on the number of euploid embryos available for transfer in their first PGD cycle: group A included patients where no euploid embryos were diagnosed; group B included patients who had only one euploid embryo; and group C included patients with at least two normal embryos resulting from chromosomal analysis. RESULTS: In subsequent cycles, group A patients underwent significantly fewer transfers (45%) compared with group B (69%, P < 0.05) and group C patients (85%, P < 0.001). The pregnancy rate per transfer was significantly decreased in group A (15%) compared with group B (36%; P < 0.02) and group C (30%; P < 0.03). Accordingly, the live birth rate per patient was significantly lower in group A compared with group C (8.5% versus 30%; P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of the first PGD for aneuploidy may have a predictive role for subsequent attempts.
