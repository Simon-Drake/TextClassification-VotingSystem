[Contemporary methods of treating age-related infertility].
Age-related infertility that is caused by diminished reproductive potential is both medical and social problem of a great concern. Changes in modern ways of life make women postpone the decision of starting up a family, what may reduce their chances of having a healthy baby. It is also a problem of subfertile couples who after many years of insufficient treating approach the period where the age imposes on primary causes of infertility, what even more reduces the chance of pregnancy. The main reason of this is increased number of chromosomal abnormalities resulting in lower quality of oocytes. There is a lot of research being held on the reconstruction of gametes by transferring the nucleus or cytoplasm among the oocytes derived from young and older patients. However, it has not brought the expected results so far. The method of preimplantation genetic diagnosis--aneuploidy screening (PGD-AS) in patients older than 35 gives some hope for improving the efficiency of infertility treatment. Nevertheless, oocyte donation still remains the most effective and applied method of assisted reproduction in the group of older patients.
