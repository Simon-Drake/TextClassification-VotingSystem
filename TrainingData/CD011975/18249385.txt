Early clinical pregnancy loss rate in poor responder patients does not change compared to age-matched normoresponders.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the early clinical pregnancy loss rate (ECPLR) of singleton gestations in poor responder (PR) patients. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: Private assisted reproductive technology center. PATIENT(S): A total of 2,157 singleton clinical pregnancies were identified, 195 from PR and 1,962 from normoresponder (NR) patients. Poor response was accepted as retrieval of four or fewer oocytes. Patients who yielded more than five oocytes were accepted as NR control group. INTERVENTION(S): Patients were age stratified as <or=35, 36-39, and >or=40 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Comparative evaluation of ECPLR in PR and NR patients according to age. RESULTS: Out of 195 singleton clinical pregnancies achieved in poor responders, 31% resulted in early clinical pregnancy loss; ECPLR were 22%, 32%, and 59% in the <or=35, 36-39, and >or=40 year age groups, respectively. When ECPLR in singleton gestations of PR patients was compared with that of NR patients according to age, no significant differences were found for all age groups. CONCLUSION(S): Early clinical pregnancy loss rate was not found to differ significantly between PR and NR patients at all age groups. Therefore, PR patients should be counseled about their lower probability of clinical pregnancy but similar ECPLR compared with their age-matched NR counterparts.
