Karyotyping or rapid aneuploidy detection in prenatal diagnosis? The different views of users and providers of prenatal care.
Developments in prenatal diagnosis raise the question which test strategy should be implemented. However, preferences of women and caregivers are underexposed. This study investigates what kind of prenatal test pregnant women and caregivers prefer and if differences between the groups exist, using self-report questionnaires. Women preferred either karyotyping (50%) or rapid aneuploidy detection (43%). Caregivers opted for the latter (78%). A test targeted on Down syndrome was the least preferred in both groups. We recommend the use of individualised choice for genetic test in prenatal diagnosis, overcoming the existing differences in preferences between women and caregivers.
