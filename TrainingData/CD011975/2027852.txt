Cytogenetic studies of amniotic fluid taken before the 15th week of pregnancy for earlier prenatal diagnosis: a report of 114 consecutive cases.
One hundred and fourteen samples of amniotic fluid taken before 15 weeks of gestation were cultured for cytogenetic studies. The results of culturing these early amniotic fluid (EAF) samples were compared with the results of culturing 114 standard amniotic fluid (SAF) samples taken after 15 weeks of gestation matched for maternal age and received in the laboratory within the same week. Cell culture was successful in all 114 of the EAF samples and in 111 SAF samples. There was no significant difference in the days to harvesting and days to reporting in the two groups. Three samples of SAF failed to grow and two EAF samples produced tetraploid karyotypes, so that in these five cases amniocentesis had to be repeated. These problems were attributed to toxicity of a fungicide used in the culture medium. Pseudo-mosaicism was noted in two EAF samples and one SAF sample; and maternal cell contamination was noted in one EAF and one SAF sample. Thus, culturing and karyotyping cells harvested from EAF and SAF are similar, indicating that EAF samples from 12-14-week pregnancies could be used for prenatal diagnosis.
