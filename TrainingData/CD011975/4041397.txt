Fetal blood chromosome analysis: some new indications for prenatal karyotyping.
Prenatal karyotyping using stimulated fetal blood lymphocytes was undertaken in 170 pregnancies between 16 and 36 weeks gestation for the following reasons--mosaicism or marker chromosomes found in amniotic fluid culture; a family history of X-linked mental retardation with fragile Xq28; fetal abnormalities detected ultrasonographically; late booking or amniotic fluid culture failure in patients with advanced age or balanced translocations; and twin pregnancies discordant for a chromosomal anomaly. Forty-one karyotypic abnormalities were detected (24%). These were: 45,X (7 cases), trisomy 13 (5 cases), trisomy 18 (6 cases), trisomy 21 (4 cases), twin pregnancy where one twin had trisomy 21 (1 case), supernumerary marker chromosome (3 cases, one of which occurred in a twin pregnancy), triploidy (3 cases), X-linked mental retardation with fragile site at Xq28 in males (6 cases), fetal erythroleukaemia (3 cases including 2 cases with Turner's), Fanconi's anaemia (1 case), unbalanced chromosome translocation 47,XY+der22,t(11;22) mat (1 case), mos 46,XX18p-/46,XX,-18+i(18q) (1 case), 46,XXdel(2q) (1 case), and 46,XYt(5;17) de novo (1 case). In fetuses at high risk of a chromosome aberration, a rapidly obtained karyotype is helpful and fetoscopy and fetal blood sampling are justified in the second or third trimester.
