Prenatal diagnosis of 45,X/46,XY mosaicism--a review and update.
A total of 54 cases with prenatal diagnosis of 45,X/46,XY mosaicism was reviewed. Of 47 cases with information on phenotypic outcome, 42 cases (89.4 per cent) were reported to be associated with a grossly normal male phenotype. Three cases (6.4 per cent) were diagnosed as having mixed gonadal dysgenesis with internal asymmetrical gonads. Two other cases were questionably abnormal. In 40 cases with successful cytogenetic confirmatory studies, the overall rate of cytogenetic confirmation of 45,X/46,XY from tissues derived from fetus/liveborn/placenta was 70.0 per cent. This review shows a major difference in the phenotypic outcome between postnatal diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis. Due to the ascertainment bias, almost all known patients with postnatal diagnosis of 45,X/46,XY mosaicism are phenotypically abnormal. Therefore, caution must be used in translating information derived from postnatal diagnosis to prenatal diagnosis. This review calls for collection of more data on 45,X/46,XY mosaicism diagnosed prenatally, more long-term follow-up of liveborn infants, and pathological studies of all abortuses. Emphasis is placed also on the importance of genetic counselling, ultrasound examination, and cytogenetic confirmation.
