Prognostic factors for preimplantation genetic screening in repeated pregnancy loss.
The objective of this study was to identify specific subgroups of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) patients of unknown aetiology in whom the selection of chromosomally normal embryos for transfer improves reproductive outcome in preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). A total of 428 PGS cycles were included and chromosomes 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y were evaluated. In RPL patients < or =37 years, a lower incidence of chromosomal abnormalities (P = 0.0004) and miscarriages (P = 0.0283) was observed, and there were significantly higher pregnancy (P < 0.0384) and implantation (P < 0.0434) rates than in patients >37 years. In the former subset, results showed: (i) significantly higher implantation rates (P = 0.0411) in couples that had experienced a previous aneuploid miscarriage; (ii) similar aneuploidy, pregnancy and implantation rates in couples suffering previous miscarriages during fertility treatments and in those with previous spontaneous pregnancies; (iii) no miscarriages after PGS in couples in whom a fluorescence in-situ hybridization assay showed the male partner's sperm to be abnormal; and (iv) lower implantation rates in couples with > or =5 previous miscarriages, associated with a lower percentage of chromosomally abnormal embryos. It is concluded that PGS is to be strongly recommended when RPL is associated with miscarriages during infertility treatments, chromosomopathy in a previous miscarriage, up to five previous miscarriages and a high incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in spermatozoa.
