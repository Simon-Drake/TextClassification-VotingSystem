Somatic mosaicism at the Duchenne locus.
Results of testing a family for carrier status and prenatal diagnosis for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are best explained by somatic mosaicism in the maternal grandfather. This genetic situation was identified using segregation analysis of intragenic DNA polymorphisms, a serum creatine phosphokinase assay, and physical examination of the patients. This event at the DMD locus represents one more potential source of error in carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.
