Immunochemical quantification of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase in prenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome.
Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) was quantified by enzyme immunoassay for prenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome. Overall, 154 samples of amniotic fluid, 72 samples of amniotic cells and 31 samples of chorionic tissue were investigated. Due to the large biological variance of the SOD concentrations in normal pregnancies (range for amniotic fluid 10.5-154.9, for amniotic cells 40.0-338.8, and for chorionic tissue 132.2-649.5 g SOD/g protein) the cases of Down's syndrome detected by karyotype analysis were not reliably identified by Cu/Zn SOD quantification. As in erythrocytes obtained from patients with Down's syndrome, a trisomy 21 was easily and accurately detected in the erythrocytes from very small quantities (about 50 microliters) of umbilical blood. The SOD concentrations in normal cases (n = 40) varied between 11.4 and 17.3 and in the cases of trisomy 21, as confirmed by karyotyping (n = 4), between 22.5 and 23.2 ng/one million cells. SOD quantification in fetal erythrocyte is a helpful additional method in prenatal Down syndrome diagnosis under certain conditions, which are discussed.
