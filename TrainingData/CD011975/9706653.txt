An assessment of two training interventions designed to increase the knowledge of obstetrical nurses and nurse-midwives about the maternal serum triple screen.
The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of two brief training interventions designed to improve nurses' and nurse-midwives' knowledge about the maternal serum triple screen. The low intervention consisted of written information on the triple screen; the high intervention consisted of written information plus a one hour oral presentation. Knowledge was assessed at baseline, immediately following the oral presentation (high intervention only), and one month following the interventions. Forty-seven nurses, nurse-midwives and nursing assistants participated. Sixteen respondents (34 per cent) who routinely talk to patients about the triple screen obtained a score of less than 70 per cent on the knowledge questionnaire at baseline assessment. Respondents' knowledge about the maternal serum triple screen included areas that needed to be improved in order for them to be able to provide patients with accurate and complete information. Both interventions assessed in this study resulted in an increase in participants' knowledge about the maternal serum triple screen, however the high intervention was more effective. This study presents evidence that improvements in health care professionals' knowledge can be made with brief educational interventions.
