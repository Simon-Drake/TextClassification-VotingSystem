Fluorescent in situ hybridization: an effective and less costly technique for genetic evaluation of products of conception in pregnancy losses.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we applied the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique and compared the common numerical abnormalities with chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, X, and Y in spontaneous to artificial abortion. This would cover about 75% of the common aneuploidy in spontaneous abortion. METHODS: Placentas were taken from 59 patients with a first trimester spontaneous abortion and 61 patients who underwent an elective first trimester pregnancy termination. The range of growth was from 5 to 12 gestational weeks. Placentas were processed according to direct chorionic villi preparation. Direct dual color FISH was performed according to Vysis protocol with the probes for the following chromosomes: 13, 16, 18, 21, X, and Y. RESULTS: The aneuploidy rate in spontaneous abortion was 55.9% and in artificial abortion 8.2%. There was a significant difference between the two groups in the aneuploidy rate (P = 6 x 10(-9)). CONCLUSION: FISH is a rapid, efficient, and relatively inexpensive tool in detecting aneuploidy in placentas from cases of spontaneous abortions. Our rate of detected aneuploidy is compatible with other reports in which conventional cytogenetics was utilized.
