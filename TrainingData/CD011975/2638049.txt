[Cytogenetic studies of families with reproductive failure].
Cytogenetic analysis carried out in 209 patients with reproduction failure demonstrated chromosomal aberrations in 6 married couples. In 5 of these cases balanced translocations were found, and in one case 45,X/46,XX cell mosaicism was present. The proportion of abnormal karyotypes in the group was 5.7% per one couple and was only slightly lower than the mean frequency of chromosomal aberrations calculated by the authors in cases of reproduction failures diagnosed in other cytogenetic laboratories in Poland-6.7%. The identical frequency of aberrations in married couples with a history of 2 or 3 or more abortions indicates the necessity of carrying out cytogenetic investigations already after two spontaneous abortions.
