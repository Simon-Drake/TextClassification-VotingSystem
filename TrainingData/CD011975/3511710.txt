Fetal cystic hygroma colli: antenatal diagnosis, significance, and management.
Twenty-four cases of fetal cystic hygroma colli were diagnosed by ultrasound. In two patients, the diagnosis was not confirmed at autopsy. Ten of these were cases of Turner's syndrome, one was a case of Turner's mosaicism, three had other aneuploidies, four had normal chromosomes, and six had a failed chromosome culture. The diagnosis, management, and future counseling of these patients are discussed.
