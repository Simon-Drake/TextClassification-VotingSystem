Non-immunological hydrops fetalis: report of 6 cases and a review.
Six consecutive cases of non-immunological hydrops fetalis (NIHF) seen by the authors over a 3-year period are presented. Two cases were due to haematological causes and 3 to cardiac anomalies; in 1 case trisomy-21 with a possible associated cardiac anomaly was present. No infant survived. On the basis of this experience and a review of the literature the associated conditions, diagnosis and management of NIHF are discussed.
