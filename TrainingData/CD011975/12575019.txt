Prenatally detected trisomy 4 and 6 mosaicism--cytogenetic results and clinical phenotype.
We report on a live-born male with 46,XY/47,XY+4/47,XY,+6 mosaicism. Trisomy 4 mosaicism was detected by karyotyping chorionic villus samples (CVS) and was confirmed by the analysis of 16 metaphases obtained from cultured amniotic fluid cells. Eight metaphases were normal (46,XY), two had trisomy 4 (47,XY,+4), and two had trisomy 6 (47,XY,+6). Two postnatal chromosomal analyses of blood lymphocytes at birth and at the age of one week were normal. Chromosomal analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts from the right inguinal region at the age of 12 months revealed trisomy 4 (47,XY,+4) in 49 metaphases, trisomy 6 (47,XY,+6) in 2 metaphases, and a normal karyotype (46,XY) in 49 cells of the 100 analyzed metaphases, respectively. The main clinical findings consist of prenatal growth retardation, hypoplasia of the right side of the face, a dysplastic and posteriorly rotated right ear, a high vaulted palate, retrognathia, aplasia of the right thumb, hypoplasia of the fingernails, a deep sacral dimple, and patchy skin hypopigmentation of the right leg. When last seen at the age of 14 months, his development was nearly normal. Five patients with trisomy 4 mosaicism have been reported previously, but none with an additional trisomy 6 mosaicism.
