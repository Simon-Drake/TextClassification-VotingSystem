Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein levels during midtrimester of trisomy pregnancies.
To investigate the association between low amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and trisomy pregnancies, we retrospectively reviewed 26 trisomy pregnancies including 18 fetuses with Down's syndrome and eight with trisomy 18. The amniotic fluid AFP median values of Down's syndrome, trisomy 18, and the study groups were 0.73 MoM, 1.15 MoM, and 0.85 MoM, respectively. There was a significant difference between the mean values of the Down's syndrome-affected fetuses (0.78 +/- 0.29 MoM) and that of the control group (p < 0.001), whereas no such difference was found for that of trisomy 18-affected fetuses (1.16 +/- 0.38 MoM). Only three patients in the study group (3/26, 11.5%) had an amniotic fluid AFP value below 0.5 MoM, including the two cases of Down's syndrome (2/18, 11.1%) and one case of trisomy 18 (1/8, 12.5%). Most of the values for the trisomy pregnancies were within the normal range, thereby precluding the possibility of using this measurement as an alternative to fetal karyotyping as a screening test for Down's syndrome or other trisomy pregnancies.
