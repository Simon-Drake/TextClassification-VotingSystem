Confined placental mosaicism in term placentae: analysis of 125 cases.
In order to determine the incidence of confined placental mosaicism (CPM) in term placentae and to show the presence of specific sites and the effect on fetal development, 125 placentae from uneventful pregnancies were analysed by cytogenetic methods. The incidence was at least 4.8 per cent and there were no specific sites on the placenta. Although the number of cases is still too small, we found CPM to be associated with intrauterine growth retardation in six cases.
