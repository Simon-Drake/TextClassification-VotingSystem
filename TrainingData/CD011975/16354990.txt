Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 with fetal cells in maternal blood using comparative genomic hybridization.
OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the clinical use of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for detection of fetal trisomy 21 from fetal ceIls (nucleated red blood cells; nRBCs) isolated from maternal peripheral venous blood. METHODS: Maternal peripheral venous blood samples were collected in sterile tubes containing heparin. After triple density gradient centrifugation, magnetic activated cell sorting using CD45 and CD71 was used to isolate the fetal nRBCs. Fetal nRBCs were successfully isolated from maternal peripheral blood in all cases. After laser-microdissecting fetal nRBCs, degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction, and nick translation, DNA size was suitable for hybridization. RESULTS: By CGH analysis, we diagnosed one normal male, one normal female, and one trisomy 21 male fetus. These results were confirmed by amniocentesis. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal diagnosis from fetal cells in maternal peripheral blood by CGH shows clinical promise as an alternative or as a supplement to fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific probes but further studies are warranted.
