Prospective prenatal diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome due to maternal disomy for chromosome 15 following trisomic zygote rescue.
We present a prenatal predictive diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome arising as a result of maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 15. The diagnosis arose following chorionic villus sampling which showed a mosaic trisomy 15 karyotype with a chromosomally normal follow-up amninocentesis. Molecular studies on DNA extracted from cultured amniocytes showed no evidence of a paternal allele at two widely separated loci and this was taken as evidence of maternal disomy predictive of Prader-Willi syndrome in the fetus.
