Docosahexaenoic acid-deficient phosphatidyl serine and high alpha-tocopherol in a fetal mouse brain over-expressing Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase.
The over-expressed Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene has been found in some circumstances phenotypically deleterious and associated with oxidative injury-mediated aberrations while in other studies it was considered neuroprotective. In this work we examine a number of biochemical markers in fetal and adult brain from transgenic (tg) mice expressing the human Cu/Zn-SOD gene, which may determine this dual characteristic. These markers include the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) profile in discrete phospholipid species, the alpha-tocopherol levels, a marker for lipid anti-oxidant status, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), a marker for the tissue oxidative status. The PUFA profile in choline- and ethanolamine-phosphoglycerides was similar in tg and nontransgenic (ntg) animals of either fetal or adult brain. Serine-phosphoglycerides, however, showed a marked decrease from 20. 07+/-0.53 to 14.92+/-0.87 wt% and 14.52+/-1.15 wt% in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n3), in the tg 51 and tg 69 fetal brains, respectively, but not in the comparable adult tissues. The alpha-tocopherol levels were significantly higher in the fetal compared to the adult brain. There were no differences in the anti-oxidant levels between the ntg and tg fetal brains, but there were differences in the adult animals; the tg mice were higher by at least two-fold than the control animals. The basal TBARS in the tg 51 fetal brain was 35% lower than that of ntg mouse and in the presence of Fe(2+), brain slices from the former released less TBARS (57% reduction) into the medium than the latter. These results suggest that higher dosages of Cu/Zn-SOD gene are compatible with increased alpha-tocopherol levels, reduced basal TBARS levels and a DHA deficiency in the fetal, but not the adult, tg brain.
