A retrospective study of preimplantation embryos diagnosed with monosomy by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
This report is a retrospective study of preimplantation embryos diagnosed with monosomy for chromosomes 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y on day 3 to determine the rate of true positives, false positives and/or mosaicism and to assess if these embryos are suitable for in vitro fertilization (IVF) transfer. In a one year period, 80 patients went through preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening (PGD-AS). Monosomy was diagnosed in 51 embryos. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was then performed on the blastomeres at day 5-7 with commercially available probes using the same probe set that initially identified monosomy for chromosomes 13, 16, 21 and 22 or chromosomes 15, 18, X and Y. Based on FISH analysis, the monosomy diagnosed during routine PGD-AS analysis was confirmed in 17 of the 51 embryos. A euploid result for the specific chromosomes tested was observed in 16 of the 51 embryos while mosaicism was found in the remaining 18 embryos. This results in an estimated false positive rate of 3.8% for a diagnosis of monosomy. Reanalysis of these embryos demonstrates that the majority of monosomy diagnoses represents true monosomy or mosaicism and should be excluded for transfer in IVF. Furthermore, improved understanding from recent emerging data regarding the fate of oocytes in women with advanced maternal age undergoing IVF to the development of early embryos may provide a valuable insight into the mechanism of chromosome mosaicism.
