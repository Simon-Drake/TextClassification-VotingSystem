Detection of chromosome aneuploidies in chorionic villus samples by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.
The objective of this study was to examine the suitability of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in chorionic villus samples as a replacement for traditional karyotyping for the detection of (an)euploidies of chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X, and Y. Chorionic villus samples were diagnosed by traditional karyotyping using short-term cultures (STC) and long-term cultures (LTC), and by MLPA using kit P095. DNA was extracted after digestion of whole villi with proteinase K and/or trypsin and collagenase. Different cell-dissociation procedures were tested to obtain MLPA results representative of the cytotrophoblast layer and the mesenchymal core. Over 95% of the MLPA results were in concordance with the traditional karyotyping of STC and LTC. Traditional karyotyping revealed seven mosaics. After digestion of whole villi with proteinase K, only abnormal cell lines confined to the STC gave rise to abnormal MLPA results. In one sample, the complete discrepancy between STC and LTC was resolved after enzymatic dissociation of cells from the cytotrophoblast layer and the mesenchymal core. MLPA in chorionic villus samples was found to be a reliable test for the detection of (an)euploidies of chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X, and Y. Whole villi digestion with proteinase K resulted in the over-representation of cytotrophoblasts in the DNA pool. To obtain MLPA results representative for STC and LTC, enzymatic dissociation of cells from the cytotrophoblast layer and mesenchymal core is required.
