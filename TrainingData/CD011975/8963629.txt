Meconium ileus and intestinal atresia in fetuses and neonates.
A collaborative study was performed to determine the different types and mechanisms of intestinal abnormalities during gestation. Cases had to fulfill one or more of the following three criteria: (1) meconium ileus, (2) intestinal stenosis or atresia, and (3) meconium peritonitis. Esophageal atresia, anorectal atresia, and abdominal wall defects were excluded. One hundred two cases were reviewed from the autopsies of 42 induced abortions, 22 stillborns, and the surgical findings in 38 neonates. Meconium ileus was detected mainly during the second trimester (28/38), and was associated with cystic fibrosis (15), fetal blood deglutition (4), infection (6), or multiple-abnormalities (10), in which three chromosomal aberrations were found. Intestinal stenosis or atresia was more commonly detected during the third trimester of gestation (46/56). Sixteen of the 30 duodenal malformations were associated with trisomy 21, whereas in the 26 small intestinal atresias, signs of distress or ischemia were most frequently detected. Only 8 of 25 meconium peritonitis cases were isolated. A total of 20 cystic fibrosis cases could be proved. In this series, functional abnormalities were observed predominantly in the second trimester and associated mainly with cystic fibrosis or amniotic fluid abnormalities. Anatomic lesions were commonly detected later on and associated with ischemic conditions, chromosomal aberrations, and even cystic fibrosis.
