Advantages of day 4 embryo transfer in patients undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis of aneuploidy.
PURPOSE: Following preimplantation genetic diagnosis of aneuploidy, embryo transfer was executed on day 4, with the aim of providing more time for expanding from six to nine the number of diagnosed chromosomes per single cell (Group 2; 45 cycles). The results obtained were compared to those derived from conventional day 3 transfer (Group 1; 71 cycles). METHODS: For multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, two panels of probes were used: the first, specific for chromosomes XY, 13, 16, 18, and 21, was tested in all patients (Groups 1 and 2); the second was implemented only in Group 2 patients for the detection of chromosomes 14, 15, and 22. RESULTS: A total of 406 embryos underwent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in Group 1, and 236 in Group 2. Comparable percentages of both chromosomal abnormalities (61% and 62%) and pregnancy and implantation rates (36% and 24.5% in Group 1, 41% and 23.6% in Group 2) resulted, regardless of the higher mean age in Group 2. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of the nine chromosomes which are most frequently associated with aneuploidy in humans could have an immediate impact on the rate of spontaneous abortions. Additional advantages are represented by the more accurate morphological evaluation of euploid embryos; the advanced compaction, which means that embryos are less exposed to damage during the transfer procedure; and the possibility of performing a reanalysis in cases where a fluorescence in situ hybridization diagnosis is not obtained.
