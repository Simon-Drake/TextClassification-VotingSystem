Translocation trisomy 21 in CVS not found in embryoblast: three different cell lines in CVS, amnion- and placental culture.
Chorionic villus samples from a healthy pregnant female were obtained for first-trimester prenatal diagnosis. A translocation trisomy 21 was diagnosed. A consecutive amniocentesis revealed a normal male karyotype. At term a healthy boy was born. Cytogenetic analysis from cord blood showed a regular karyotype of 46,XY, whereas in term placenta a pathological karyotype of 47,XY, +mar was found.
