Prenatal diagnosis of an isochromosome 5p in a fetus with increased nuchal translucency thickness and pulmonary atresia with hypoplastic right heart at 14 weeks.
We report on a fetus presenting with increased nuchal translucency at 11 weeks' gestation, suggesting cystic hygroma. Chorion villous sampling was performed, and cytogenetic analysis revealed a supernumerary isochromosome 5p leading to tetrasomy 5p: 47,XX,+ i(5p)[7]/46,XX[5] after short-term culture and 47,XX,+ i(5p)[20] after long-term culture. Subsequent targeted sonographic follow-up at 12 and 14 weeks revealed further increase of the NT to 6.4 mm and the additional presence of a congenital heart defect (pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum). Termination of pregnancy was performed, and the heart defect was confirmed. Isochromosome 5p was found in varying proportions in all examined organs. Only a few cases of mosaic tetrasomy 5p have been reported in the literature, and recent reports on prenatally detected isochromosome 5p showed a possible relationship to increased nuchal translucency in some cases and also a possible role of confined mosaicism in others. Whereas cases with confined mosaicism did not show suspicious signs on ultrasound, true mosaicism conversely showed increased nuchal thickness as well as structural abnormalities. This is the first report on the association of a cardiac defect with this chromosome aberration.
