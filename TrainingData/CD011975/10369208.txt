Screening oocytes and preimplantation embryos for aneuploidy.
Pregnancy and live birth rates following in-vitro fertilization decline rapidly with advancing maternal age partly because of an increase in age-related aneuploidies occurring in female meiosis. Screening oocytes or preimplantation embryos for common aneuploidies is now possible by polar body or cleavage stage biopsy and multicolour fluorescence in-situ hybridization.
