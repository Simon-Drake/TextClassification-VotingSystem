Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 9 mosaicism possibly limited to fetal membranes.
In repeat amniotic fluid cultures mosaicism due to trisomy 9 was noted. Autopsy of the aborted female fetus showed a sinus urogenitalis and gonadal dysgenesis with absence of germ cells only. Fetal lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts had a normal karyotype but trisomy 9 was found in cells grown from placenta. It is likely that trisomic cells were limited to fetal membranes.
