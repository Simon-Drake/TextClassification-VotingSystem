First-trimester nuchal translucency and cardiac septal defects in fetuses with trisomy 21.
OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the incidence of cardiac septal defects in fetuses with trisomy 21 diagnosed by increased nuchal translucency thickness at 10 to 13 weeks' gestation. STUDY DESIGN: Pathologic examination of the fetal heart was performed in 36 fetuses with trisomy 21 after suction termination of pregnancy at 12 to 15 weeks' gestation. The diagnosis of trisomy 21 was made by chorion villus sampling because of increased (> or = 3 mm) fetal nuchal translucency thickness detected at routine first-trimester ultrasonographic examination. RESULTS: Perimembranous ventricular and atrioventricular septal defects were detected in 20 of 36 fetal hearts. A septal defect was observed in 1 of the 11 fetuses with nuchal translucency thickness of 3 mm and in 19 of the 25 with translucency > or = 4 mm (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of ventricular and atrioventricular septal defects is much higher in fetuses with trisomy 21 and increased nuchal translucency thickness at 10 to 13 weeks' gestation than in live-born infants with this chromosomal abnormality. The incidence of cardiac septal defects increases with nuchal translucency thickness.
