The utility of embryo banking in order to increase the number of embryos available for preimplantation genetic screening in advanced maternal age patients.
PURPOSE: to determine if embryo banking with PGS is more optimal than proceeding with PGS regardless of embryo number. METHODS: patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 were those that banked embryos and proceeded through another round of IVF prior to PGS, and group 2 underwent PGS regardless of embryo number. Group 2 was divided into group 2A (patients with >10 embryos) and group 2B (patients who had <10 embryos). RESULTS: there was no difference in embryos biopsied, normal embryos, number transferred, and pregnancy rate between group 1 and 2. A significant number of patients did not have a transfer in group 2B (6/11) compared to group 1 (3/19) (P = 0.0419). There was no significance between pregnancy rates per transfer between group 1 (6/16) and group 2B (2/5). CONCLUSION: our data suggests that banking will increase the odds of going to transfer but there was no increase in pregnancy rates.
