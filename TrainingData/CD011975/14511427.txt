Screening for aneuploidy in twin pregnancies: maternal age- and race-specific risk assessment between 9-14 weeks.
The aim of this study was to calculate the risk for aneuploidy in twin pregnancies between 9-14 weeks utilizing maternal age, race and dizygotic twinning rates. Using previously published risks for aneuploidy in singletons and twins at the time of amniocentesis and at term, we calculated new risk estimates for twins at 9-14 weeks gestation or at the time of chorionic villus sampling. Using these tables, the risk for trisomy 21 in at least one fetus of a twin gestation in a 32-year-old at 9-14 weeks is 1/285 for Whites and for African-Americans. This is equivalent to the risk for trisomy 21 (1/265) in a 35-year-old woman with a singleton at the same gestational age. The risks for trisomies 18 and 13 also follow similar trends. In counseling women with twin pregnancies at the time of first trimester nuchal translucency screening or chorionic villus sampling, it should be noted that the maternal age-related risk for aneuploidy for a 32-year-old is equivalent to that of a 35-year-old woman with a singleton gestation.
