[Invasive methods of prenatal diagnosis of congenital and hereditary pathology].
The paper presents an experience with invasive prenatal diagnostic tests in 409 pregnant women at a high risk for perinatal diseases. Techniques of amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, placenta biopsy, chordocentesis, cardiac fetal puncture are described and their efficacy and safety compared. Indications and contraindications for the invasive procedures are reviewed. Concomitant use of noninvasive and invasive techniques is suggested for improving the efficacy of prenatal diagnosis.
