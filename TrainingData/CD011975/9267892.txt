Amniotic fluid and maternal serum levels of CA125 in pregnancies affected by Down syndrome: a re-evaluation of the role of CA125 in Down syndrome screening.
In a study of amniotic fluid from 91 Down syndrome cases and 240 controls, we have shown that the median value of CA125 in pregnancies affected by Down syndrome on the whole reflects those observed in the maternal serum from 106 affected cases and 238 controls. The median MOM for CA125 in amniotic fluid from Down syndrome pregnancies was 1.04 and in maternal serum 1.06, neither value being significantly different from that for the control population. We confirm our previous observation that CA125 is not a marker of Down syndrome and conclude that CA125 has no role to play in Down syndrome screening.
