The influence of image magnification in first-trimester screening for Down syndrome by fetal nuchal translucency in Asians.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of image magnification in the measurements of crown-rump length (CRL) and nuchal translucency (NT) thickness for first-trimester Down syndrome screening in Asians. METHODS: Ultrasound measurements of NT and CRL were performed in 561 consecutive Taiwanese unaffected fetuses and 11 cases of Down syndrome fetuses between 12 and 14 weeks of gestation. All sonographic images were measured by one qualified examiner to prospectively undergo first-trimester NT screening for Down syndrome. Fetal CRL and NT thickness were measured on three separated images including the original image, regular image, and the magnified image. RESULTS: A significant mean difference (0.59 +/- 4.24 mm) of CRL was found between measurements on the original and regular image (p < 0.001). There was a significant mean difference of NT thickness measurements between the regular and magnified image (0.12 +/- 0.25 mm, p < 0.001). Seven out of the 11 cases (63.6%) of Down syndrome with NT thickness > or =2.5 mm was measured on three separated images. A significantly reduced incidence of NT thickness > or =2.5 mm on the magnified image was noted than those of the original and regular image measurements in unaffected cases (p < 0.001). Either using the assessing method by the 95th centile cutoff value of NT thickness or combined risk, our results could achieve observed detection rate of 63.6% measured on three separated images. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the image magnification could reduce the false-positive rate by using a fixed cutoff value of NT thickness, but would have no influence on the results when using the assessing method either by the 95th centile cutoff value of NT thickness or the combined risk. In order to place the caliper more accurately, a magnified image should be recommended as a standard image in the measurements of the NT thickness.
