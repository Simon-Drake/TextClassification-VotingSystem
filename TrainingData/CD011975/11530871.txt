Non-immune hydrops fetalis in the first trimester: a review of 30 cases.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the etiology and outcome of non-immune hydrops fetalis diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: 30 cases with fetal hydrops diagnosed between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy at the prenatal diagnosis unit of Istanbul Medical Faculty were reviewed. Sonographic findings, fetal chromosome profiles, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: NIHF was found to be associated with structural abnormalities in 25 (83.3%) cases, and chromosomal abnormalities in nine (47.3%) of the 19 analyzed cases. Nuchal translucency measurements were greater than 3 mm in 28 of the cases (93.3%), and cystic hygroma was the most common detected abnormality (n: 22; 73.3%). All pregnancies with nonimmune hydrops resulted in abortion, intrauterine fetal death, or termination of the pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Fetal hydrops diagnosed in the first trimester of gestation is associated with a higher incidence of aneuploidy, and it has a high mortality, even in fetuses with normal chromosomes.
