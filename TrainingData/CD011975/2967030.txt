Maternal age-specific rates of 47,+21 and other cytogenetic abnormalities diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy in chorionic villus biopsy specimens: comparison with rates expected from observations at amniocentesis.
Results are presented on chromosome analyses made on 4,481 embryos or fetuses studied through chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in whom there was no known bias to presence of a chromosome abnormality except advanced parental age. We excluded from the analysis most cases in which mosaicism was diagnosed or in which there were cytogenetic discrepancies among samples obtained from the conceptus. There remain 48 cases of 47,+21, 39 cases of other nonlethal abnormalities, and 12 lethal abnormalities diagnosed in 4,481 studied. A regression analysis (restricted to the 3,848 cases diagnosed in the 35-49-year maternal age interval) was done on rates of (1) 47,+21, (2) other abnormalities excluding lethals or (3) including them, and (4) all abnormalities excluding lethals or (5) including them. The model used was y = exp(bx + c), where y is the rate of abnormality, x is maternal age at time of CVS (the modal age of the procedure was 10 gestational weeks from the last menstrual period), and b and c were, respectively, (1) 0.288 and -15.527; (2) 0.272 and -15.173; (3) 0.253 and -14.141; (4) 0.282 and -14.753; and (5) 0.271 and -14.195. We also derived rates of abnormalities at the time of CVS that would be predicted from rates (of nonmosaics) at amniocentesis after adjustment for the difference in gestational age between the usual times that these two procedures are done. The difference between the numbers of abnormalities predicted on the basis of these adjusted amniocentesis rates and the numbers observed at CVS provides an estimate of the spontaneous loss of embryos and fetuses between the usual gestational ages of these procedures. In these data, for 47,+21 the estimated proportion lost is 21% but the result is not significant at the .05 level. For other abnormalities excluding lethals the estimated spontaneous loss is 29% (P approximately .05); including lethals it is 44%. For all abnormalities, excluding lethals, pooled together, the estimate is 24%; including lethals it is 33%. The last three values are all significant at the .05 level or lower. The observed rates of abnormalities at CVS would be approximately 10% to 15% higher if one pooled diagnosed mosaics with the nonmosaics, but the estimated proportion of spontaneous fetal loss would be lower.
