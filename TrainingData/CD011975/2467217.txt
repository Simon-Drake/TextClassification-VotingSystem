Maternal serum and amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein testing: our approach to screening, diagnosis and counseling.
Maternal serum and amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein testing has increased significantly in our laboratory and throughout the state since 1985. The results of this test are reported in a novel fashion as multiples of the median. The calculation and reporting of the test results are highly dependent upon gestational age, maternal weight, race and presence or absence of maternal diabetes. When properly interpreted alpha-fetoprotein determinations are a good screening test for early detection of neural tube defects and Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome). Our approach to screening, diagnosis and counseling is discussed.
