Weights of fetuses with autosomal trisomies at termination of pregnancy: an investigation of the etiologic factors of low serum alpha-fetoprotein values.
In order to determine whether the low values of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein observed with autosomal trisomies are associated with smaller fetal weights, 50 fetuses with Down syndrome (trisomy 21), 10 with trisomy 18, and 65 normal control fetuses, all aborted in the second trimester of pregnancy, were compared. The mean multiple of the median maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein was found to be 0.79 +/- 0.61 for fetuses with Down syndrome and 0.50 +/- 0.26 for those with trisomy 18, both results being significantly lower than results from the control fetuses (0.97 +/- 0.86). No significant difference in the weight distribution between fetuses with Down syndrome and control fetuses, corrected for gestational age, was found. By contrast, fetuses with trisomy 18 had a significantly lower weight distribution compared with that of the control fetuses (p less than 0.001). A linear relationship was found in normal fetuses between maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values and fetal weight at a given gestational age. Fetal weight does not seem to account for the lower maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels seen in fetuses with Down syndrome but may partially account for the lower levels seen in fetuses with trisomy 18.
