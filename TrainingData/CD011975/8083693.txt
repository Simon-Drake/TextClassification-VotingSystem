Development of the superior temporal neocortex is anomalous in trisomy 21.
Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation in the United States, however, the basis of impaired cognition is unknown. We have used recently developed stereological cell counting techniques to quantitatively examine the pattern of neuronal migration and maturation in one neocortical area during gestation in normal development and in trisomy 21. Normal development of the cerebral cortex occurs in two general sequences: Beginning at approximately 7-8 weeks gestation, migration of cells destined to become neurons results in the accumulation of cells in the cortical mantle. This process is largely complete by 20-21 weeks. Over the next 7-10 weeks an "inside-out" differentiation into lamina of different neuronal densities occurs. Our data suggest that the second phase of cortical development, the emergence of lamination, is both delayed and disorganized in trisomy 21. The observed pattern of cortical maturation may reflect an abnormality in axonal and dendritic arborization that subsequently subserve the connectional and functional units underlying normal cognition.
