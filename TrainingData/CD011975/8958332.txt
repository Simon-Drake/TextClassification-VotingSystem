Comprehensive 4-year follow-up on a case of maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 16.
Uniparental disomy for chromosome 16 has been previously identified in fetal deaths and newborn infants with limited follow-up. Thus there is a lack of information about the long-term effects of maternal uniparental disomy 16 on growth and development. We present a case of maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 16 and a comprehensive 4-year physical and cognitive evaluation. Cytogenetic analysis of chorionic villus obtained at 10 weeks gestation for advanced maternal age showed trisomy 16. At 15 weeks, amniocentesis demonstrated low level mosaicism 47,XY,+16[1]/46,XY[25]. Decreased fetal growth was noted in the last 2 months of pregnancy and the infant was small for gestational age at birth. Molecular studies revealed only maternal alleles for chromosome 16 in a peripheral blood sample from the child, consistent with maternal uniparental heterodisomy 16. Although short stature remains a concern, there appears to be no major cognitive effects of maternal disomy 16. Clinical evaluation and follow-up on additional cases should further clarify the role of placental mosaicism and maternal disomy 16 in intrauterine growth retardation and its effects on long-term growth in childhood.
