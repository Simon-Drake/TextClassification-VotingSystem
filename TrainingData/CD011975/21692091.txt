Erroneous production of PAPP-A kits: the impact of a downward shift in PAPP-A concentration on the test performance of first-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a 20% downward shift in the pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) concentration on the test performance of first-trimester combined screening (FTS) for Down syndrome (DS) following a flaw in the production of PAPP-A kits on FTS for DS. METHODS: A retrospective re-evaluation of PAPP-A in stored sera. Inclusion criteria were a maternal weight-corrected PAPP-A multiple of the median value >/= 0.9 and a biochemical risk of DS </= 1:200 at the time of testing. RESULTS: Of the 3100 women, 473 (15%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. After combining the biochemical risk based on the incorrect PAPP-A values with nuchal translucency findings, an increased risk for DS was initially found in 107 women [false positive rate (FPR): 3.1]. Eighty-two (77%) of the 107 women opted for invasive testing. Following re-analysis of PAPP-A, the biochemical risk and the combined risk were statistically significantly different from the initial risk estimates (p < 0.001.). We noticed that 25 women (30%) had invasive testing, while this was unjustified given the re-analysed PAPP-A. CONCLUSION: Erroneous PAPP-A kits resulted in an increase in the FPR by 1.2%. There were no reports of iatrogenic miscarriage. The occurrence of this problem reaffirms the importance of continuous monitoring of quality in FTS.
