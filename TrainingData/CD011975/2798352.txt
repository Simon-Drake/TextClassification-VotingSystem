Trisomic 22 placenta in a case of severe intrauterine growth retardation.
We describe a case in which a trisomic 22 placenta could be the cause of severe growth retardation in a chromosomally normal female fetus. At amniocentesis a mosaic 46,XX/47,XX, +22 was observed in amniotic fluid specimens sampled on two different occasions, while fetal blood from a diagnostic cordocentesis revealed a normal chromosome constitution. Postnatal studies showed the consistent presence of trisomic 22 cells in the placenta, while only normal metaphases were found in amnion, blood, and fibroblast cultures.
