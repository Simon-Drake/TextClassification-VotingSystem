FISH preimplantation diagnosis of chromosome aneuploidy in recurrent pregnancy wastage.
PURPOSE: Our purpose was to detect aneuploidy for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y in preimplantation embryos from patients with a history of unexplained recurrent miscarriage. METHODS: Three patients with a history of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion were included in this study. Embryos were biopsied at the eight-cell stage, individually fixed on slides, and processed for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). A multiple FISH protocol for seven chromosomes pairs (13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y) has been developed. RESULTS: A total of 39 embryos was studied with the multiple FISH protocol developed. Successful analysis of the biopsied embryos was achieved within the time limits usually allowed in a preimplantation diagnosis program. Analysis of the blastomeres showed that 17 embryos were chromosomally normal for the probes used, 16 embryos were aneuploid, and in 6 embryos no informative results were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: In the patients studied, a large proportion of embryos (41%) exhibited chromosomal abnormalities for the probes used. Preimplantation diagnosis to screen for chromosome abnormalities could be a feasible approach to improve the possibility of successful pregnancy in these couples.
