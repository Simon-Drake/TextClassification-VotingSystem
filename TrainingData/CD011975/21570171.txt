Maternal serum IGF-I, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 at 11-13 weeks in trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 pregnancies.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible value of maternal serum concentration of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and IGFBP-3 in first-trimester screening for fetal aneuploidies. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal serum concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 at 11-13 weeks of gestation were measured and compared in 30 trisomy 21, 30 trisomy 18 and 120 euploid pregnancies. RESULTS: The median multiple of the normal median (MoM) values of maternal serum IGF-I, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 in trisomy 21, trisomy 18 and euploid pregnancies were not significantly different (IGF-I: 1.10, 1.14 and 1.0 MoM, respectively; IGFBP-1: 1.10, 1.01 and 1.0 MoM; IGFBP-3: 0.90, 1.16 and 0.98 MoM). CONCLUSION: Measurement of maternal serum IGF-I, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 at 11-13 weeks of gestation is unlikely to be useful in screening for trisomies 21 and 18.
