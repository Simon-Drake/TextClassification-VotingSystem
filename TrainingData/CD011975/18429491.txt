Inhibins as diagnostic markers in human reproduction.
Over the past 75 years, many publications have focused on measurement of inhibin concentration and/or activity in biological samples in order to understand its role in physiology and disease. This chapter highlights the accomplishments within this area of research over the past decade including development of specific inhibin assays. Inhibin A is a marker of dominant follicle and corpus luteum activity and decreases in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Inhibin A increases in gestational diseases such as pre-eclampsia and fetal Down's syndrome, and this increase in inhibin A improves early diagnosis of both conditions. The measurement of inhibin A in women with threatened abortion provides useful information about the likelihood of pregnancy loss. Inhibin B increases markedly in women with granulosa cell tumor and appears closely related to gametogenesis in men, that is, reflecting Sertoli cell activity. On the contrary, Inhibin B decreases in women with declining ovarian function and correlates with female response to ovulation induction. This review evaluates the biochemical significance ofinhibins including their use in clinical practice.
