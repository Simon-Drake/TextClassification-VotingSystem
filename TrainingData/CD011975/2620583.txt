[Prediction of the malignant tendency of hydatidiform mole by determination of DNA content].
The cellular DNA content of paraffin-embedded molar tissue blocks obtained from the first curettage was measured by flow cytometry in 64 cases of hydatidiform mole. Of these 64 cases 32 developed malignant changes and 32 remained persistently benign during a period of follow-up of 0.5 to 7.5 years. The proportion of aneuploid was 59.4% in patients demonstrating malignant changes and 34.4% in those with persistent benign diseases. The difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). This preliminary result suggests that DNA aneuploid may be used as a parameter for the prediction of possible malignant changes and selecting of indications for prophylactic chemotherapy.
