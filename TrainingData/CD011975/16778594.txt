Knowledge and attitudes concerning medical genetics amongst physicians and medical students in Cameroon (sub-Saharan Africa).
PURPOSE: Little is known about physician's knowledge of, and attitudes toward genetics in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: Survey of 101 pre-clinical, 95 clinical medical students, and 110 physicians, in Cameroon. RESULTS: The awareness of DNA diagnosis was poor: 0, 2.2, and 1.2%, respectively, for sickle cell anemia. The majority of the respondents considered genetic counseling as indispensable (97.6, 98.9 and 100%); and prenatal diagnosis as acceptable. The acceptance of medical abortion increased with the level of medical education (62.6, 74.7 and 90.7%). Sickle cell anemia was considered as a "serious disease" by a greater majority of respondents than Down syndrome (P < 0.001). But, in all three groups, the acceptance of termination of affected pregnancy "if the respondent's own child was affected" was lower for sickle cell anemia than Down syndrome (22.4 versus 40.2%, 10.8 versus 29.3% and 36.1 versus 70.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest a poor knowledge of genetic tests among medical students and physicians. This cohort appears to accept the principles of medical genetics. Our data emphasized a need to introduce genetics and to develop research on its ethical and social implications in Cameroon.
