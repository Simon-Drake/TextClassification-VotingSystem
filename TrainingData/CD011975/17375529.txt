Prenatal diagnosis of a mosaic 45,X/46,X,r(X)46,XX with a small ring of the X chromosome.
We report the prenatal diagnosis of a mosaic 45,X/46,X,r(X)/46,XX foetus after amniocentesis for maternal second-trimester serum screening. Biparental contribution for the X chromosomes suggest the postzygotic formation of the X ring. The ring is tiny but contains the X-inactive-specific transcript gene (XIST). However, we could not determine whether XIST was correctly expressed or not. The foetal ultrasound examination at 21, 25, 31 weeks' gestation showed no physical abnormalities, prompting the parents to continue the pregnancy. Physical examination at one year-old revealed normal growth and psychomotor development. Only three cases exhibiting an identical 45,X/46,X,r(X)/46,XX mosaicism, but detected postnatally, are reported in the literature. This is the first reported case ofa mosaic 45,X/46,X,r(X)/46,XX identified in the prenatal period.
