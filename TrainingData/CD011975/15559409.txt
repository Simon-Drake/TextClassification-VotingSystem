[Prenatal investigations for Down's syndrome: medical-technical considerations and dilemmas arising from current screening methods].
Prenatal investigations can be divided into specific diagnostic investigations i.e. chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis and selective ultrasonography for the detection of fetal abnormality, and screening tests which estimate the chances of the condition being present. These include routine ultrasonography and tests based on biochemical and echoscopic markers. Amniocentesis is the most reliable test to detect chromosomal anomalies, but is associated with a low risk of miscarriage and the results are known only relatively late in pregnancy. Implementing the prenatal screening tests will enable the better identification of those women with an increased risk of chromosomal anomalies, and consequently to fewer invasive diagnostic procedures. The choice whether to have prenatal screening should always be made by the parents after they have been told of the advantages and disadvantages of these investigations.
