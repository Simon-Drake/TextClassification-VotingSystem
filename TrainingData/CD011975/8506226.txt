Rapid detection of aneuploidy in uncultured chorionic villus cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Rapid detection of aneuploidy using chromosome-specific repetitive DNA probes and the potential diagnostic accuracy of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on interphase cells of chorionic villus samples (CVS) are presented. Analyses demonstrated the ability to correctly identify aneuploidy using FISH in uncultured CVS. Our preliminary investigation suggests that this technique offers a significant clinical potential to circumvent problems of culture, time, and cost in cytogenetic analysis.
