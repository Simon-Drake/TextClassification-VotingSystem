Sacro-coccigeal teratoma: antenatal diagnosis and management.
We report a case of sacro-coccygeal teratoma (ScT) in a 29 years old primigravida at 19 weeks of gestation. Ultrasonographic evaluation in antenatal management of these abnormalities is discussed. The main sonographic criteria appear to be two: dimension and rapid growth of the tumour. Cariotype must be performed to exclude aneuploidy, frequently associated.
