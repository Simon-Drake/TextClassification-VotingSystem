[Prenatal screening and diagnostics after infertility treatment].
Women who get pregnant after infertility treatment differ from women with naturally conceived pregnancies concerning prenatal screening: on average they are older and therefore they have a greater risk of carrying a child with Down's syndrome, their children have an increased risk of congenital malformations, and they have a great wish to avoid invasive prenatal diagnostic tests. The conclusion of this review is that first trimester screening is an acceptable choice for these women, although larger studies are needed to clarify whether a correction factor is necessary for the biochemical markers.
