The elusive search for fetal infection. Changing the gold standards.
Two percent to four percent of all newborns have a major structural malformation of which only a small percentage can be explained by either aneuploidy or a single-gene disorder. No other mammal has a similar reproductive problem. It is the suggestion that previously unrecognized viral infection accounts for a large percentage of these abnormalities by interfering with appropriate embryonic cell migration, reducing hyperplasia, or damaging the precursor structure by means of an inflammatory mechanism.
