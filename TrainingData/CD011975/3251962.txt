[Cell sorting in flow cytometry].
The aim of the presentation is to introduce a dramatic accomplishments of high technology and the current applications of medicine, particularly in the field of Gynecology and Obstetrics. An author's demonstration includes both of a brief basic concept of window and fraction sorting and some clinical applications. Cell sorting based on genotypic (neoplastic) and phenotypic markers of a benign and malignant lesions of female genital tract seems to be expressed at the cellular and molecular level in terms of degree of cell growth, differentiation and functions, which are not readily appreciated by descriptive morphology. DNA aneuploidy is a conclusive marker of malignant characteristics and a monoclonal antibodies of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), an analog of thymidine, is an available identification of DNA synthetic cells. Among phenotypic cell markers, surface membrane antigens have been extensively studied on the immunological state in pregnancy, peripheral lymphocyte subsets from pregnant women by the use of monoclonal antibodies. From gynecological and obstetrical patients management perspective, a role of cell sorting technology in flow cytometry is emerging as a tool for diagnosis of cancer (DNA abnormalities and cell cycle analysis) multiparameter analysis in quantitation (DNA base pairs, RNA and protein), surface markers for immunological state in pregnancy (membrane antigen and monoclonal antibodies), prognosis (adverse impact of aneuploidy and high S percentage using BrdU with monoclonal antibody) and targeting cytotoxicity to steroid responding tumor cells (estrogen receptor and site-directed chemotherapy).
