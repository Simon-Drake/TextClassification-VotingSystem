The effect of fast reporting by amnio-PCR on anxiety levels in women with positive biochemical screening for Down syndrome--a randomized controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of fast reporting by polymerase chain reaction on amniotic fluid cells (amnio-PCR) on anxiety levels in women with positive biochemical screening for Down syndrome. METHOD: Between May 2000 and April 2001, 60 screen-positive women were randomized before amniocentesis into either having (group A) or not having (group B) fast-reporting by amnio-PCR. Anxiety levels were measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory just prior to amniocentesis, three days (when PCR results were known to group A) and three weeks (when standard karyotype results were known to both groups) afterwards. RESULTS: Two women were excluded because in one woman amnio-PCR showed trisomy 21 and the other miscarried shortly after amniocentesis. The state-anxiety scores increased over the three-week period after being informed of the positive-screen result in both groups. The trait- and state-anxiety scores at all points did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the general belief, fast reporting by amnio-PCR did not alleviate anxiety in women who are screen-positive for Down syndrome.
