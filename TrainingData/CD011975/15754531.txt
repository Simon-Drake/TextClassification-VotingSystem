[Sonographic first trimester screening in Switzerland].
The sonographic measurement of the nuchal translucency is already regarded as the most valuable screening parameter for chromosomal anomalies. Beside standardised examinations profound information and counselling of the pregnant women should be emphasised. With the improvement of the specific maternal risk calculation using the sonographic measurement of the nuchal translucency, the biochemical markers and the maternal age, unnecessary invasive examinations may be prevented and their overall number can be reduced significantly.
