Abnormal karyotype in the chorion, not confirmed in a subsequently aborted fetus.
An abnormal fetal karyotype, containing a del 16(q21-qter) as an extra chromosome, was diagnosed in all 14 metaphases examined in a sample of chorionic villous biopsy material. After elective abortion a mosaicism for this cell-line together with a normal one was detected in the chorionic tissue. Fibroblast cultures from several fetal skin biopsies all revealed a normal karyotype.
