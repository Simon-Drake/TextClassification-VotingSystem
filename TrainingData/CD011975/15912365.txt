Double bubble, double trouble.
Duodenal atresia (DA) is not uncommon, either as an isolated anomaly or associated with trisomy 21, malrotation, or cardiac anomalies. It may be diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound by a "double-bubble" sign, which typically persists after birth on a plain abdominal radiograph. DA as a familial association is rare but has been reported with or without other associated anomalies. We report DA in two siblings of nonconsanguineous parents, one case occurring with an annular pancreas in association with gestational diabetes. These two cases suggest possible genetic and environmental components in the aetiology of this anomaly.
