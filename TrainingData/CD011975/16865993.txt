[Molecular-cytogenetic study of the aborted fetuses in women with reproductive function disorders].
It is known that the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities among spontaneous miscarriages of the first trimester of pregnancy makes 50-60%. Research of karyotypes of chorionic villus cells of miscarriages has been conducted by combining the standard cytogenetic method and the FISH analysis on interphase nuclei of centromeric specific DNA samples by the tests to the chromosomes 13/21, 14/22, 15, 16, 18, X, Y. The described complex approach can be successfully applied for effective identification ofchromosomal abnormalities in the material of spontaneous miscarriages. The results specify the necessity of careful study of genomes of matrimonial pairs with the usual unmaturing in anamnesis and especially before treatment by IVF methods.
