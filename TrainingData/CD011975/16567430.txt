Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 13: analysis of 28 cases.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of second-trimester sonographic examination in the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 13. METHODS: Of 22,150 fetal chromosome analyses, 28 fetuses with trisomy 13 were found between 1990 and 2004. Sonographic findings of this aneuploidy were analyzed in this study. RESULTS: The average maternal age was 32.4 years; the average gestational age was 19.5 weeks. There was an 89.3% (n = 25) total prevalence of sonographic abnormalities in fetuses with trisomy 13 in this series. Major (structural) malformations were seen in 23 cases (82.1%), whereas minor anomalies were detected on sonography in 16 cases (57.1%). Although in 2 fetuses 1 minor anomaly was the only sonographic sign of trisomy 13, other cases with minor anomalies (87.5% [n = 14]) were multiplex malformations, in which combinations of major and minor anomalies were detected on sonography. The most frequently seen structural abnormalities were central nervous system and facial anomalies (64.3% [n = 18]). Among central nervous system anomalies, ventriculomegaly and holoprosencephaly were seen most frequently. Cardiovascular anomalies were detected in 53.6% (n = 15) of the fetuses with trisomy 13. This high frequency underlines the importance of echocardiography in diagnosing this aneuploidy. Among minor anomalies, increased nuchal translucency (21.4%) and echogenic bowel (17.9%) were the most common findings. CONCLUSIONS: Second-trimester sonographic examination is capable of showing anomalies that are characteristic of trisomy 13; thus, the scan can indicate whether fetal karyotyping is advisable. Incorporation of careful assessment of the fetal cardiovascular system by sonography certainly increases the detection rate of trisomy 13.
