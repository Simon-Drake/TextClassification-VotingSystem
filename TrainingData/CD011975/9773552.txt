[Congenital chylothorax].
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study the prenatal diagnosis, clinical manifestations and karyotype results in congenital chylothorax. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective survey of a 20 year period was carried out. The prenatal diagnosis, maneuvers following delivery, malformations and clinical outcome were studied. RESULTS: We found 10 cases of congenital chylothorax. Four were diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound with pleural effusion and no other signs of hydrops and six were diagnosed postnatally. Of the later, five had respiratory distress and one was diagnosed by radiological procedures. In all 10 cases, postnatal thoracocentesis was performed for diagnosis and therapy, five infants required mechanical ventilation and four parenteral nutrition. One patient died 72 hours after birth and three within 24 hours of birth. The clinical outcome of the rest was successful and were placed on a medium-chain triglyceride formula that was given orally. Of the eight karyotypes studied, six trisomy 21 were found. CONCLUSIONS: The prenatal diagnosis of pleural effusion permits prompt recognition of congenital chylothorax and allow for appropriate treatment upon birth. Medical therapy including pleural drainage and total parenteral nutrition and medium-chain triglyceride formula for oral feedings is successful in the majority of cases. Down's syndrome should be considered in fetuses or newborns with pleural effusion.
