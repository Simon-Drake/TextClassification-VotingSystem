ICAM-1 in maternal serum and amniotic fluid as an early marker of preeclampsia and IUGR.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if plasma and amniotic fluid levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) at 16 weeks' gestation could be predictive of preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was undertaken in 44 serum samples stored for Down's syndrome screening at 16 weeks' gestation and 44 amniotic fluid samples obtained by midtrimester amniocentesis. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between women who subsequently developed preeclampsia or IUGR and the control group. CONCLUSION: This study failed to demonstrate that ICAM-1 may be an early serum marker of preeclampsia or an amniotic fluid marker of IUGR.
