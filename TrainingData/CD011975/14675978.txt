A questionnaire study of women's views regarding the effectiveness of serum Down screening in north west Wales.
Questionnaires were circulated to 300 women awaiting mid-trimester anomaly scanning in north west Wales to determine women's views of the adequacy of counselling, availability of pretest scanning, method of receiving test results and whether the Down screening process in general was acceptable. Seventy-five per cent of respondents had serum Down screening; 80.3% of women agreed or strongly agreed that counselling prior to antenatal testing for Down syndrome was adequate; 80.7% of women agreed or strongly agreed that the consequences of a high risk result were explained before testing; 88.7% of women agreed or strongly agreed that they had a choice as to whether screening was accepted or not; 81.7% of women agreed or strongly agreed that they were involved in the decision process; and 40.0% of women having Down testing did not have previous ultrasound biometry. Routine pretest ultrasound scanning remains a resource priority.
