Screening for aneuploidy.
Over the past 15 years, biochemical screening for chromosomal abnormalities, particularly Down's syndrome, has advanced from being extremely naive, to now somewhat more sophisticated. Sensitivities have gone from 20% to 60-70%. Considerable work is still required to not only increase the sensitivity, but also the specificity to keep health care costs down.
