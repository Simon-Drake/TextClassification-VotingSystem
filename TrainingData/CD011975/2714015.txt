Trisomy 5 mosaicism in amniotic fluid with normal outcome.
A case of prenatally diagnosed true mosaicism for trisomy 5 with a clinically normal outcome is presented. Trisomy 5 was detected in 23% of cells obtained by amniocentesis, but it was not detected from cells obtained by fetal blood sampling. While in this case the finding at amniocentesis did not reflect the status of the fetus, care must be exercised in reaching this conclusion in all cases.
