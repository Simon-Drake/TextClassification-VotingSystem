Pregnancy after cryopreservation of donor oocytes and preimplantation genetic diagnosis of embryos in a patient with ovarian failure.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the successful use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to assess the prevalence of meiotic errors after oocyte cryopreservation in an oocyte donation cycle. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Private IVF center. PATIENT(S): A 42.6-year-old patient with ovarian failure. INTERVENTION(S): A donor oocyte IVF cycle with cryopreservation of oocytes followed by thaw, fertilization of oocytes, preimplantation genetic diagnosis for selective aneuploidy, and ET. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Preimplantation genetic analysis of chromosomes 13,16,18, 21,22, X, and Y with fluorescence in-situ hybridization. RESULT(S): The recipient's initial serum beta-hCG level was 196 mIU/mL 15 days after oocyte retrieval. An initial ultrasound at the sixth week of gestation revealed two gestational sacs. A second ultrasound 1 week later showed a monochorionic twin in sac A and a singleton pregnancy in sac B. Fetal cardiac activity was visualized for all gestations. CONCLUSION(S): This case illustrates the feasibility of cryopreservation of donor oocytes combined with preimplantation genetic diagnosis for clinical use in those settings where there may be an increased risk of spindle-related abnormalities.
