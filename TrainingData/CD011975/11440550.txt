Three-dimensional ultrasound measurement of the placental volume in early pregnancy: method and correlation with biochemical placenta parameters.
Placental size has been an interesting topic of research for many years. The main aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of measuring the placental volume at the end of the first trimester using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and to correlate these volumes to known placental functional indices and to factors affecting the placenta. Women with singleton pregnancies at the end of the first trimester were included into this study. The volume data of the placentae were correlated to the crown-rump length (CRL), placenta-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), free beta-human chroangiogonadotropin (f-beta-hCG) and other factors that may affect the placental size or function. A total of 1462 pregnancies could be evaluated. Comparison between CRL and placental volume proved a significant correlation (r=0.43, P< 0.001). Due to the observed proportional growth of CRL and placental volume, a quotient (placental volume/CRL) was calculated for each case. There were no differences between placenta/CRL-quotients in relation to gravidity, parity or smoking. Correlations could be established between the placental volume and PAPP-A and f-beta-hCG (PAPP-A: r=0.28, P< 0.001, f-beta-hCG: r=0.10, P< 0.001). The measurement of the placenta in the first trimester can be performed in a high percentage of cases. The placenta/CRL quotient represents a simple method to compare placentae from different gestational days. The correlation between placental volume and maternal serum screening parameters might provide a chance to refine first trimester Down's syndrome serum screening. Future studies will be needed to evaluate the possible clinical use of first trimester placental volume measurements.
