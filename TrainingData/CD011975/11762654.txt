Total alpha-fetoprotein and Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive alpha-fetoprotein in fetal chromosomal abnormalities.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the differences in multiples of the median (MoM) of total alpha-fetoprotein, and the proportion of Lens culinaris agglutinin reactive alpha-fetoprotein (% alpha-fetoprotein-L2 + L3) in the maternal serum and amniotic fluid of pregnant women whose fetuses were diagnosed with autosomal or sex chromosomal abnormalities. DESIGN: Prospective consecutive series. SETTING: University hospital. SAMPLE: Maternal sera and amniotic fluids from 46 pregnant women with trisomy 21 fetuses, 10 pregnant women with trisomy 18 fetuses, one pregnant woman with a trisomy 13 fetus, six pregnant women with fetal sex chromosomal abnormalities, and 100 pregnant women for whom the fetal karyotype was diagnosed as normal following a genetic amniocentesis. RESULTS: The proportion of alpha-fetoprotein-L2 + L3 in maternal serum for trisomy 21 (40.3%. P < 0.0001) and trisomy 18 (39.8%, P < 0.05) showed a significantly higher value compared with normal (32.6%). The proportion of alpha-fetoprotein-L2 + L3 in amniotic fluid was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) for trisomy 21 (46.6%) than for a normal karyotype (41.5%). Only for the trisomy 21 group was there a strong correlation in the % alpha-fetoprotein-L2 + L3 between maternal serum and amniotic fluid (r = 0.840, P < 0.0001). For all groups, there was no correlation between alpha-fetoprotein MoM and % alpha-fetoprotein-L2 + L3 in maternal serum and amniotic fluid. CONCLUSION: The proportion of alpha-fetoprotein-L2 + L3 in maternal serum is an appropriate choice for a trisomy 21 biochemical marker, and it is possible that combining alpha-fetoprotein-L2 + L3 analysis with assays of alpha-fetoprotein in maternal serum could further improve the sensitivity and specificity of multiple marker screening.
