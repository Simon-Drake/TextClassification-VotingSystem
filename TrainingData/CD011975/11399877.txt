Prenatal detection of facial clefts.
OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) the antenatal detection rate for isolated cleft lip and/or cleft palate during the routine anomaly scan; (2) the correlation between prenatal diagnosis and postnatal findings, and (3) the association of apparently isolated cleft lip and/or cleft palate with other anomalies, in particular chromosomal abnormalities. METHOD: A population-based retrospective analysis of all cases of isolated cleft lip and/or cleft during an 8-year period in an academic teaching hospital in the UK. RESULTS: Thirty-nine cases of isolated cleft lip and/or cleft palate were identified among deliveries at the hospital. Twenty-eight cases had a routine anomaly scan. Fourteen cases were detected prenatally (sensitivity 50%). None of the isolated cleft palates was detected, while 14 of 20 cases of cleft lip (70%) were detected. One of the isolated cases of cleft lip was associated with trisomy 21, while 3 of the isolated cleft palate cases were associated with the Pierre Robin syndrome. In all cases, an antenatal diagnosis of cleft was confirmed following delivery or post-mortem examination (specificity 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound is a useful tool in screening for cleft lip with or without cleft palate, but not for cleft palate alone. Even with an isolated cleft lip, there is an increased risk of chromosomal abnormality. The role of prenatal education and support is extremely important in the preparation of prospective parents and can help alleviate the shock which occurs when there is an unexpected cleft at birth.
