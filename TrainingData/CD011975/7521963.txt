Maternal serum inhibin levels in second-trimester Down's syndrome pregnancies.
Maternal serum inhibin levels were measured in 19 second-trimester pregnancies affected by fetal Down's syndrome and 95 unaffected control pregnancies matched for gestational age. A statistically significant elevation was found in the affected pregnancies compared with the controls (Wilcoxon rank sum test: one-tail P = 0.02). The median level in the cases was 1.3 times that in the controls, with 95 per cent confidence limits of 0.9-1.9. Although the inhibin levels were unrelated to those of alpha-fetoprotein and unconjugated oestriol in the same samples, there was a statistically significant correlation with human chorionic gonadotropin. This together with the relatively small elevation in cases suggests that inhibin would be of limited value in maternal screening for Down's syndrome.
