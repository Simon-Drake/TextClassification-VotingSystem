Twin pregnancy discordant for trisomy 14 mosaicism: prenatal sonographic findings.
The survival of infants with trisomy 14 mosaicism has been scarcely reported in the literature, with only 15 cases being documented up to 1992. We present a case of a dichorionic twin pregnancy in which prenatal sonography at 24 weeks' gestation showed that one of the twins had several anomalies including intrauterine growth restriction, alobar holoprosencephaly, a cleft lip and palate, a recessive chin, a small stomach, overlapping fingers, a ventricular septal defect, and polyhydramnios. Twin 2 was structurally normal. In view of the lethal condition and associated polyhydramnios affecting one of the twins, prenatal surveillance for signs of tense polyhydramnios and premature labour was undertaken. The pregnancy proceeded uneventfully until 37 weeks, at which time a Caesarean section was performed. At birth, neonatal blood from the abnormal twin confirmed trisomy 14 mosaicism in 12 per cent of lymphocytes. The infant died on day 36 of life.
