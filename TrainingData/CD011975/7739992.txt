Genetic amniocentesis in biamniotic twin pregnancies by a single transabdominal insertion of the needle.
We present a technique to aspirate amniotic fluid from both sacs in biamniotic twin pregnancies using a single abdominal insertion with a spinal needle. It was successful in 48 out of 55 cases of biamniotic twin pregnancies referred to our perinatal unit between 1985 and 1994. The single insertion technique was used when the inter-amniotic membrane was clearly evident and two separate free amniotic fluid pools could be reached by the operator with a single puncture. An adequate amount of amniotic fluid was sampled from both sacs to make a cytogenetic diagnosis in all cases. There were four fetuses with trisomy 21 in three twin pregnancies. In two cases, only one twin was affected whilst the co-twin was normal, so that a selective feticide was performed. No miscarriages due to genetic amniocentesis were reported. After 1990, all genetic amniocenteses in biamniotic twin pregnancies (except for one case due to late booking) were performed between 14 and 15 weeks of gestation and with all cases except one, it was possible to sample both twins by a single puncture. We suggest that early amniocentesis (14-15 weeks) by a single abdominal puncture could be a reliable and safe alternative to first-trimester chorionic villus sampling in twin pregnancies.
