[Intestinal atresia: what is changed in the last 30 years].
The changes occurred in the management of intestinal atresia in the last 30 years are presented. On the basis of a series of 55 neonates (29 M/26 F; 14 premature; mean body weight 2640 g, range 1340-4100 g; 23 duodenal, 30 small bowel, 2 colon) four aspects of this malformation are discussed; epidemiology, diagnostics, therapy and prognosis. Epidemiology. 40% incidence reduction is detected; unchanged the relative incidence of Down neonates with duodenal atresia. Diagnostics. Prenatal US scan useful in 4 of 8 cases only; emphasized the usefulness of plain X-ray abdomen. Perioperative treatment. Dramatic impact of the artificial nutrition on the management of short bowel syndrome, with 7 cases (residual small bowel from 75 to 9 cm, mean 40 cm) successfully treated. Surgical technique. Confirmed the validity of the one-stage termino-terminal anastomosis. Prognosis. Significant improvement in the last three decades respectively with 50%, 87% and 93% of long-term survivors. In the first decade 6 over 8 deaths were related to the atresia, while in the last 10 years the only death recorded was related to an associated severe cardiac malformation.
