'False-negative' and 'false-positive' prenatal cytogenetic results due to 'true' mosaicism.
A 37-year-old gravida was referred for CVS because of advanced maternal age. A trisomy 21 was present in all cells after short-term incubation (direct processing (DP)) and long-term culture. According to our policy, a retap was offered for confirmation of the result during the legally required 3-day waiting period between communication of the result and termination of pregnancy. Unexpectedly all cells after DP showed a normal male chromosome complement. Further investigations revealed mosaicism in trophoblast tissue and a normal karyotype in amniotic fluid cells and fetal blood (50 mitoses each). The parents elected to continue the pregnancy after extensive ultrasound examinations did not show suspicious findings. After the birth of a healthy child, cell cultures from ten different placental sites confirmed mosaicism. Four out of 100 mitoses from a lymphocyte culture showed an additional chromosome 21. The child had no dysmorphic features and the development was normal at the age of 10 weeks. This case demonstrates the restricted validity of prenatal cytogenetic analysis in the presence of true fetal mosaicism. It also stresses the benefit of our policy to offer a retap in cases with abnormal cytogenetic results prior to termination of pregnancy which is considered unnecessary by many cytogeneticists.
