Health literacy and patient understanding of screening tests for aneuploidy and neural tube defects.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if health literacy is associated with patient understanding of prenatal screening tests for fetal aneuploidy and neural tube defects. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study on a cohort of English-speaking patients receiving prenatal care in two resident-staffed ambulatory clinics. Health literacy was measured using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine-7. Understanding of the prenatal screening tests was assessed using a modified Maternal Serum Screening Knowledge Questionnaire. RESULTS: Over an 8-month period, 125 patients were approached, and 101 (81%) consented to the study. Thirty-eight (38%) women demonstrated low health literacy. Patients with low health literacy were more likely to demonstrate inadequate understanding when compared to those with adequate health literacy (97% versus 11%, respectively; P < 0.01). Similarly, patients with < 12th grade education were more likely to have inadequate understanding when compared to patients with > 12th grade education (53% versus 30%, respectively; P = 0.02). Health literacy is a more sensitive and specific predictor of inadequate understanding than education (sensitivity 84% versus 70%, respectively, P < 0.05; specificity 98% versus 47%, respectively, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with low health literacy are more likely to demonstrate inadequate understanding of these prenatal screening tests than women with adequate health literacy.
