Down's syndrome and maternal age in British Columbia, 1972--75.
The occurrence of Down's syndrome in British Columbia during the period 1972-75 is analyzed with respect to maternal age distribution. This period is compared with previously studied periods. No marked trends are evident in the various age group-specific rates studied. The significance of these findings is discussed in connection with a possible role of environmental nutagens in induction of Down's syndrome and the maternal age effect.
