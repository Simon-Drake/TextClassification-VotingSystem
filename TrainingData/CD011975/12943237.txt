Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), an antioxidant enzyme, is under-expressed in Down syndrome fetal brains.
Suppression subtractive hybridization performed on Down syndrome (DS) versus control fetal brains revealed differential expression of peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), mapped at 13q12. Peroxiredoxins are antioxidant enzymes involved in protein and lipid protection against oxidative injury and in cellular signalling pathways regulating apoptosis. The under-expression of PRDX2 observed in DS samples was confirmed by real-time PCR (0.73-fold). To test whether decreased expression is associated with enhanced sensitivity of DS neurons to reactive oxygen species, we down-regulated PRDX2 through stable transfections of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with antisense contructs of the complete PRDX2 coding sequence. In addition, we over-expressed SOD1 and compared the effects of the two genes on cell viability. Cells transfected with either construct showed similar sensitivity to oxidative stress in addition to increased apoptosis under basal conditions and after treatment with oxidative cytotoxic agents. This suggests that the decreased expression of PRDX2 may contribute to the altered redox state in DS at levels comparable to that of the increased expression of SOD1.
