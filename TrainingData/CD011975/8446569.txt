Prospective maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin screening for the risk of fetal chromosome anomalies and of subsequent fetal and neonatal deaths.
A prospective study of maternal serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) measurement for the selection of pregnancies with an increased risk of fetal trisomy 21 was undertaken in 24,000 pregnancies from 1 January 1989 to 31 December 1990. Maternal serum was sampled at 15-18 weeks of gestation. hCG was measured in one laboratory, with one technique. This 'hCG high level' technique was developed for this screening. Amniocentesis was offered to each woman with a maternal serum hCG level above the cut-off. The follow-up of the pregnancies is known in 92 per cent of cases. The combination of hCG values and maternal age gave a detection efficiency of 63 per cent for trisomy 21 with rates of amniocentesis of 30 per cent for patients aged 37 years. 20 per cent for patients aged 35 or 36 years, and 5 per cent for patients under 35 years of age. Based on this prospective study, an individual risk was calculated combining the serum hCG value and maternal age. Seventy-four per cent of trisomy 13, trisomy 18, triploidy, and 5p-deletion were detected either in the same selected group of women or in combination with ultrasonography performed when hCG values were very low. The follow-up study showed that women who had high or low hCG values represented a group at high risk for fetal or perinatal death.
