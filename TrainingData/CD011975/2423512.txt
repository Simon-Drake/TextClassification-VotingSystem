One of the antigenic determinants of paired helical filaments is related to tau protein.
Paired helical filaments (PHF) are unusual neuronal fibers which accumulate progressively in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The insolubility of PHF in various kinds of solvents enabled us to obtain highly purified PHF, but prevented the application of conventional analytical methods to identify their components. Here we report that antibodies against purified PHF recognize tau protein, a brain-specific microtubule-associated protein, suggesting that a portion of PHF is tau protein.
