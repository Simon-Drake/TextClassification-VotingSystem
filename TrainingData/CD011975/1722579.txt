First-trimester screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Preliminary results. Dutch Working Party on Prenatal Diagnosis.
We have started a multicentre trial to study the possibilities of first-trimester maternal serum screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Maternal blood samples were obtained before 13 weeks of gestation. We present the preliminary results of the first 950 patients on alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Results on cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) in Down's syndrome and normal pregnancies are also presented. We conclude that the results on AFP are promising and that CA 125 might be predictive for fetal Down's syndrome.
