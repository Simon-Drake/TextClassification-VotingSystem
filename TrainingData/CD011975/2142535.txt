[Chorionic villi sampling: experience of the initial 500 samples].
We report our experience in first trimester antenatal diagnosis since 1984. Transcervical chorionic villus sampling (CVS) was performed in 498 pregnancies. The rate of abnormal pregnancies was 6%, the rate of chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy) in the indication group "maternal age" was 2%. The fetal loss rate (until 28 weeks) was 3.4% (17 cases), the procedure related loss plus the background loss was 2.4% (12 cases). For 92.8% of the patients a diagnosis was available after 1 CVS procedure. Ultimately an antenatal diagnosis was given to 99% of the women through a second CVS procedure or an amniocentesis or a cordocentesis. No maternal complication was observed.
