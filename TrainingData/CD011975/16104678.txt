First-trimester risk assessment: twin gestations.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of first-trimester screening in multiple gestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the literature revealed numerous studies in this area. However, most of the studies involved first-trimester singleton pregnancies. RESULTS: The few studies that reviewed the experience with multiple gestations demonstrated feasibility of this technique. However, the detection rate for twin gestations was less than that of singleton gestations. CONCLUSION: Although the data support the value of screening twins with biochemistry and ultrasound in the first trimester, further study is necessary to determine the most sensitive method.
