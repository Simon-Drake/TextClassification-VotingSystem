[Serum screening for fetal Down syndrome in pregnant women with an indication for prenatal diagnosis because of age: fewer amniocenteses].
OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of maternal serum screening for foetal Down's syndrome (DS) on the number of amniocenteses in women with an indication for prenatal diagnosis because of age > or = 36 years. DESIGN: Longitudinal descriptive study. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital Groningen. METHOD: Between October 1, 1990 and March 31, 1994, sera from 693 women, 36 years or older with a singleton pregnancy, were tested (alpha-foetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotrophin) to calculate the likelihood of their having a foetus with DS. RESULTS: 195 pregnant women (28%) were screen-positive (risk of having a foetus with DS > or = 1:250); 105 of these (54%) chose to have an amniocentesis. Of the remaining 498 (screen-negative) women, 22 (4%) chose to have an amniocentesis. All 7 cases of DS were in the screen-positive group. CONCLUSION: Maternal serum screening in women aged > or = 36 years can markedly reduce the number of invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures, with a minimal reduction in the detection of DS foetuses. It is advisable to offer this form of screening to all women in this age group.
