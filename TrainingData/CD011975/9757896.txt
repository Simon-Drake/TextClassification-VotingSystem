Spermatozoa with chromosomal abnormalities may result in a higher rate of recurrent abortion.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sperm aneuploidy can lead to abortion. DESIGN: Clinical study. SETTING: Couples with reproductive problems evaluated in a private diagnostic laboratory. PATIENT(S): Two men whose wives had histories of multiple abortions. INTERVENTION(S): Whole and Percoll-processed semen samples were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The results of fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULT(S): Aneuploidy rates in Percoll-processed samples were higher than those found in whole specimens. Aneuploid spermatozoa also displayed greater motility. CONCLUSION(S): Sperm aneuploidy should be studied before and after Percoll capacitation in all couples with unexplained infertility.
