Clinical outcome of mild fetal ventriculomegaly.
OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the outcome of fetuses with mild cerebral ventriculomegaly. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively collected all cases of mild cerebral ventriculomegaly (transverse diameter of the atrium of the cerebral lateral ventricles between 10 and 15 mm) diagnosed antenatally between January 1990 and December 1996. Associated ultrasonographic abnormalities including markers of aneuploidy, presence of chromosomal anomalies, structural malformations detected at birth, and neurologic outcome were recorded. Outcome information was available on all cases. In addition, published series of cases of fetal mild cerebral ventriculomegaly were reviewed to identify prognostic indicators. RESULTS: Eighty-two cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 48 were isolated and 34 were associated with other ultrasonographic markers or anomalies. Among the 45 surviving euploid isolated cases, neurologic follow-up was normal at a mean age of 28 months (range 3 to 72 months). Male fetuses and those with a transverse atrial size <12 mm had a good prognosis. Ventricular atria > or =12 mm were more often associated with other anomalies (56% vs 6%) and, when isolated, with abnormal postnatal neurodevelopment (23% vs 3%). Aneuploidy was present in two cases of isolated mild cerebral ventriculomegaly, both of which were associated with advanced maternal age, and in seven cases associated with other anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: Mild cerebral ventriculomegaly should prompt targeted ultrasonographic examination, inclusive of markers of aneuploidies, visualization of the corpus callosum, and echocardiogram as well as serologic evaluation for congenital infections. In isolated mild cerebral ventriculomegaly genetic counseling should take into account clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic findings. A review of the published series suggests that cognitive or motor delay is predominantly mild and that it occurs in about 9% of cases of isolated mild cerebral ventriculomegaly.
