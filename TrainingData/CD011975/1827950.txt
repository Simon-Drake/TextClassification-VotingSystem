The role of the transcerebellar view in the detection of fetal central nervous system anomaly.
The current resolution of antenatal ultrasonography permits the sonologist to visualize and critically evaluate the cerebellum and cisterna magna. Abnormalities in the size and shape of these structures will assist the sonologist in the detection of the majority of central nervous system malformations.
