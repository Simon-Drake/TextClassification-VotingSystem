Elevated human chorionic gonadotropin levels in pregnancies with sex chromosome abnormalities.
Numerous reports have dealt with the usefulness of the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein marker (MsAFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (MshCG) levels in the detection of Down syndrome (DS) and other autosomal trisomies. Only few reports have discussed the possible association of elevated levels of MshCG and sex chromosome aneuploidy. We wish to report on 3 cases in which this association was found.
