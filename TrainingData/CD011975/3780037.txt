The fetal pathology of the XXXXY-syndrome.
A second case of fetal XXXXY-syndrome detected by prenatal chromosome analysis is presented. The pathological findings include a facial aspect featuring fetal Down's syndrome, hypogenitalism and hypogonadism with excessive reduction of germ cells and also skeletal abnormalities that may be interpreted as early changes, preceding phalangeal shortening V and radioulnar synostosis.
