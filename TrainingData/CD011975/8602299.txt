Cardiac gene expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide in trisomic fetuses.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the increased nuchal translucency of trisomic fetuses is the consequence of heart failure by examining cardiac expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide genes. METHODS: Cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured in fetal hearts from 15 pregnancies affected by trisomy 21 or 18 at 12-16 weeks' gestation and from 30 normal controls at 10-20 weeks. RESULTS: In normal fetuses, mRNA levels of atrial natriuretic peptide decreased, but levels of brain natriuretic peptide did not change significantly with gestation. In trisomic fetuses, mRNA levels of both atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly higher than in gestational age-matched normal controls. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide genes are transcribed prenatally, and the findings in trisomic fetuses suggest that the increased translucency of trisomic fetuses may be the consequence of heart failure.
