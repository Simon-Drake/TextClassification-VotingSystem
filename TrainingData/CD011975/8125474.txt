The utilization of interphase cytogenetic analysis for the detection of mosaicism.
This study describes a method for defining mosaic aneuploidy by interphase cytogenetics based on statistical limits established from control specimens. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used to detect the number of copies of specific chromosomes in interphase nuclei from placental tissues of diploid controls and mosaic placentas. FISH was performed using probes D7Z1/D7Z2, D9Z1, D10Z1, and D18Z1, all purchased from Oncor, Inc. Statistical analysis of data obtained from diploid controls was used to determine the one-sided upper reference limit and corresponding 95% confidence interval for the proportion of cells with one and three signals for each of the probes used. The one-sided upper reference limits established the lower levels of monosomy and trisomy detectable using each of the four probes. These statistical parameters were then used to interpret the results obtained by FISH applied to the study of term placentas for the confirmation of prenatally diagnosed chromosomal mosaicism.
