Detection of translocations involving the Y-chromosome in prospective prenatal screening of common chromosomal aneuploidies by FISH.
In the application of the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique for prospective prenatal screening of common aneuploidies involving the autosomes 13, 18, and 21, and sex chromosomes, six cases of inconsistency between the results of FISH analysis and the results of karyotyping of cultured amniocytes have been observed, including two cases of translocation involving the Y-chromosome and chromosome 15 in a total of 904 cases of amniocentesis studied. In one case, the translocation was of maternal origin, and in the other, of paternal origin. In both cases, the couples decided to continue the pregnancy and normal babies were delivered. The data show the usefulness of applying the FISH technique in prospective prenatal screening of common trisomies for the possible detection of rare chromosome rearrangements involving the Y-chromosome.
