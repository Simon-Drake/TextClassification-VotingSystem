The impact of rapid aneuploidy detection (RAD) in addition to karyotyping versus karyotyping on maternal quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of rapid aneuploidy detection (RAD) combined with fetal karyotyping versus karyotyping only on maternal anxiety and health-related quality of life. METHODS: Women choosing to undergo amniocentesis were selected into group 1, i.e. receiving a karyotype result only (n = 132) or to group 2, i.e. receiving both the result of RAD and karyotyping (n = 181). RESULTS: There were no systematic differences in time of RAD combined with karyotyping versus karyotyping only in terms of anxiety (P = 0.91), generic physical health (P = 0.76, P = 0.46), generic mental health (P = 0.52, P = 0.72), personal perceived control (P = 0.91) and stress (P = 0.13). RAD combined with karyotyping reduced anxiety and stress two weeks earlier compared to karyotyping only. CONCLUSION: RAD as add-on to karyotyping reduces anxiety and stress in the short term but it does not influence overall anxiety, stress, personal perceived control, and generic mental and physical health when compared to a karyotype-only strategy.
