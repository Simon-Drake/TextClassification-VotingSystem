Preclinical validation of a microarray method for full molecular karyotyping of blastomeres in a 24-h protocol.
BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) has been used in an attempt to determine embryonic aneuploidy. Techniques that use new molecular methods to determine the karyotype of an embryo are expanding the scope of PGS. METHODS: We introduce a new method for PGS, termed 'parental support', which leverages microarray measurements from parental DNA to 'clean' single-cell microarray measurements on embryonic cells and explicitly computes confidence in each copy number call. The method distinguishes mitotic and meiotic copy errors and determines parental source of aneuploidy. RESULTS: Validation with 459 single cells of known karyotype indicated that per-cell false-positive and false-negative rates are roughly equivalent to the 'gold standard' metaphase karyotype. The majority of the cells were run in parallel with a clinical commercial PGS service. Computed confidences were conservative and roughly concordant with accuracy. To examine ploidy in human embryos, the method was then applied to 26 disaggregated, cryopreserved, cleavage-stage embryos for a total of 134 single blastomeres. Only 23.1% of the embryos were euploid, though 46.2% of embryos were mosaic euploid. Mosaicism affected 57.7% of the embryos. Counts of mitotic and meiotic errors were roughly equivalent. Maternal meiotic trisomy predominated over paternal trisomy, and maternal meiotic trisomies were negatively predictive of mosaic euploid embryos. CONCLUSIONS: We have performed a major preclinical validation of a new method for PGS and found that the technology performs approximately as well as a metaphase karyotype. We also directly measured the mechanism of aneuploidy in cleavage-stage human embryos and found high rates and distinct patterns of mitotic and meiotic aneuploidy.
