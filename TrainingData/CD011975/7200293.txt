[Twin pregnancy with operative removaL of one fetus with chromosomal mosaicism 46,XX/45,XO and term delivery of a healthy baby].
During antenatal amniocentesis in a case of twin pregnancy, a healthy child 46,XY and a Turner-mosaic 46,XX/45, XO are diagnosed. The parents wish for an abortion, with an attempt to save the healthy child. the affected child is removed by sectio parva in the 22nd week of pregnancy, and the other child is delivered by caesarean section in the 39th week. Our experiences with regard to the management of dizygotic twins where antenatal morbidity of one of the fetuses occurs are compared and discussed with two similar cases from the literature.
