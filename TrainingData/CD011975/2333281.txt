Isolation of fetal DNA from nucleated erythrocytes in maternal blood.
Fetal nucleated cells within maternal blood represent a potential source of fetal genes obtainable by venipuncture. We used monoclonal antibody against the transferrin receptor (TfR) to identify nucleated erythrocytes in the peripheral blood of pregnant women. Candidate fetal cells from 19 pregnancies were isolated by flow sorting at 12 1/2-17 weeks gestation. The DNA in these cells was amplified for a 222-base-pair (bp) sequence present on the short arm of the Y chromosome as proof that the cells were derived from the fetus. The amplified DNA was compared with standardized DNA concentrations; 0.1-1 ng of fetal DNA was obtained in the 20-ml maternal samples. In 7/19 cases, a 222-bp band of amplified DNA was detected, consistent with the presence of male DNA in the isolated cells; 6/7 of these were confirmed as male pregnancies by karyotyping amniocytes. In the case of the female fetus, DNA prepared from samples at 32 weeks of gestation and cord blood at delivery also showed the presence of the Y chromosomal sequence, suggesting Y sequence mosaicism or translocation. In 10/12 cases where the 222-bp band was absent, the fetuses were female. Thus, we were successful in detecting the Y chromosomal sequence in 75% of the male-bearing pregnancies, demonstrating that it is possible to isolate fetal gene sequences from cells in maternal blood. Further refinement in methodology should increase sensitivity and facilitate noninvasive screening for fetal gene mutations.
