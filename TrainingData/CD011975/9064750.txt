[Couple treatment following abortion in prenatal diagnosis. An interdisciplinary and interprofessional cooperation].
Various research studies have shown that prenatal diagnosis has a considerable effect on the couple, irrespective of the result of the diagnosis or the couple's decision. If a couple decides to terminate pregnancy as a consequence of the diagnostic outcome, the ensuing mourning process is known to be similar to mourning after stillbirth; either way it means the loss of a wanted pregnancy. Also, deliberate termination intensifies guilt feelings, especially if, as in Down's syndrome, the anomaly would not have affected the child's viability. For these reasons, psychological support for such couples is primarily aimed at overcoming the loss of a wanted pregnancy. Among the important recurrent topics are the couple's guilt feelings, their fear of another pregnancy with a traumatizing outcome, their insecurity regarding their relationship and sexual life, and possibly an impaired self-image. Since a certain relief may be felt in the first hours or days after the interruption and negative feelings may develop only later, it is very important to ensure long-term counseling and support. Indeed, it would be appropriate and helpful if psychological counseling could be taken up prior to prenatal diagnosis, so that the best solution for the couple can be worked out calmly in conjunction with them.
