Lymphatic capillary hypoplasia in the skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency and Turner's syndrome: comparison with trisomies and controls.
Fetuses with Turner's syndrome or trisomies 21, 18 and 13 show excess of skin, which can be visualized by ultrasonography as increased nuchal translucency at 11-13(+6) weeks' gestation. The objective of this study was to gain insight in the development and distribution of blood vessels, lymphatic capillaries of the cutis and lymphatic collectors of the cutis and subcutis and to study developmental changes with increasing gestation. Immunofluorescence of cryosections with 10 specific antibodies was used to investigate the nuchal skin of three fetuses with Turner syndrome's and to differentiate lymphatics, lymph capillaries (FLT4, PTN 63, LYVE1, PROX1), blood vessels (KDR, CD 31, PDPN), blood clotting activity (von Willebrand factor), basement membranes and big vessels (Laminin, Collagen Type IV). The findings were compared with those in seven fetuses with trisomy 21 and two fetuses each with trisomies 18 or 13, respectively, as well as six normal controls. Immunoreactive receptors for vascular endothelial growth factors (FLT4) were decreased in lymphatic capillaries of the skin of Turner fetuses. Accordingly, LYVE1 was scarce and PROX1 staining was less intense in the dermis of Turner fetuses. Lymphatic collectors were, however, evenly stained. In normal fetuses and in those with trisomies, lymphatic capillaries were evenly distributed. We conclude that lymphatic capillary hypoplasia might be responsible for nuchal cystic hygroma in Turner syndrome. The biological basis for increased nuchal translucency in trisomies may however be different.
