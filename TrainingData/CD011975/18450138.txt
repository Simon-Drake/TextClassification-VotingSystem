Ethics is an essential dimension of first-trimester risk assessment for trisomy 21.
We identify the clinical implications of the ethics of informed consent for risk assessment for trisomy 21. Based on the ethics of informed consent, we argue that routinely offering first-trimester risk assessment in centers qualified to provide it is ethically obligatory. We describe how pregnant women can be expected to respond to this offer. We then argue that routinely withholding the results of first-trimester risk assessment is ethically unjustified. The ethics of informed consent is an essential dimension of first-trimester risk assessment for trisomy 21.
