Plasminogen activator system in serum and amniotic fluid of euploid and aneuploid pregnancies.
OBJECTIVE: To compare euploid and aneuploid pregnancies with respect to maternal serum and amniotic fluid (AF) levels of the components of the plasminogen system. METHODS: The study population consisted of 123 single pregnancies at the 17th gestational week, 16 with minor chromosomal abnormalities, 15 aneuploid, and 92 euploid. RESULTS: Both groups with chromosomal abnormalities had significantly higher serum levels of urokinase plasminogen activator and its complexed form with its type-1 inhibitor compared with euploid pregnancies. In AF, tissue plasminogen activator was significantly lower in the aneuploid than the euploid group, whereas type-1 inhibitor of plasminogen activator was significantly higher in the cases with minor chromosomal abnormalities compared with euploid. At cutoff levels set at 100% sensitivity, the complexed form of urokinase plasminogen activator with its type-1 inhibitor had the strongest specificity (66.3%); after logarithmic transformation, its serum level was 7.53 times higher in aneuploidies than euploidies. CONCLUSION: Aneuploid pregnancies appear to be accompanied by abnormalities of the plasminogen activation system, which could lead to impaired placental perfusion and thus to abortion, fetal death, and fetal growth restriction.
