Further observations of true mosaic trisomy 17 ascertained in amniotic fluid cell cultures.
Three new cases of true mosaic trisomy 17 (MT17) were diagnosed in amniotic fluid cells. Postnatal chromosome analysis from lymphocytes did not confirm the trisomic cell line, and follow-up studies showed normal psycho-motor development of the children, in one case up to the age of 4 1/2 years. We suggest that there are similarities between MT17 and MT20, in which the majority of pregnancies result in deliveries of healthy babies.
