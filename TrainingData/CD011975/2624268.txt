Decisions following the intrauterine diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidy.
This is a report of 327 phone calls to our center concerning the intrauterine diagnosis of sex chromosome abnormalities (SCA). The first author (A.R.) responded to each by counseling either the parents or the referring professional. Sixty-two percent continued the pregnancy. When the parents were counseled directly, the percentage continuing the pregnancy was significantly higher than when the information was transmitted through the professionals. Our results are different from most reports in these situations, and suggest that well-informed couples, counseled by geneticists, are more likely to continue these pregnancies. The possible occurrence of SCA should be considered in preamniocentesis counseling.
