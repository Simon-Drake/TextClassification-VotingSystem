Pregnancy outcome in Hispanic patients with unexplained positive triple marker screening for Down syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare pregnancy outcomes in Hispanic patients with a positive serum triple marker screen for Down syndrome and normal fetal karyotype with Hispanic women who had a negative triple marker screen. METHODS: This prospective investigation involved Hispanic gravidas who underwent maternal serum screening. A power analysis was performed to determine the sample size. Fifty women with false-positive screens for Down syndrome were matched with a control group of 100 women with a negative screen. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: An adverse pregnancy outcome occurred in 14% of the study group and in 13% of controls. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of preterm labor (p > 0.5), pre-eclampsia (p > 0.1), intrauterine growth restriction (p > 0.5), or fetal demise (p > 0.5). CONCLUSION: Hispanic patients with unexplained positive triple marker screen for Down syndrome do not appear to be at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.
