Twin trisomies-Edward and Patau syndromes.
OBJECTIVE: To report the rare occurrence of dichorionic diamniotic twins with dissimilar aneuploidies. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: District general hospital. PATIENT(S): A 36-year-old woman conceived by in vitro fertilization. Dichorionic diamniotic twins were found to have elevated nuchal translucencies and cystic hygromas. Intrauterine deaths occurred at 13 and 17 weeks gestation. INTERVENTION(S): Medical termination of pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Karyotypes. RESULT(S): Cytogenetic studies confirmed Edward's and Patau's syndromes. CONCLUSION(S): The aetiology is unknown but maternal age and in vitro fertilization may be linked since the incidence of aneuploidy rises with maternal age and the incidence of twins' increases with assisted reproductive techniques. This case highlights the need for obstetricians to have good communication and counselling skills.
