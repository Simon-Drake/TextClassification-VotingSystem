Molecular study of 45,X conceptuses: correlation with clinical findings.
The parental origin of the single X in 45 cases (40 liveborns and 5 fetuses) with a 45,X karyotype was studied using polymorphic DNA probes. The single X was paternal in origin (Xp) in 10 cases (22.2%) and maternal (Xm) in 35 cases (77.8%). Y chromosome material was detected in 1 out of the 35 cases with a 45,Xm constitution. Analysis of parental ages and clinical data of the patients with respect to the origin of the single X revealed no significant differences between the origins.
