Effect of adjustment of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Our objective was to determine the effect of the 20% upward adjustment of maternal serum alphafetoprotein (MSAFP) in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) on the number of patients that would be classified at increased risk for pregnancy complicated by either Down syndrome (DS) or neural tube defect (NTD). We retrospectively evaluated a database containing 63,110 patients who underwent multiple serum marker screening between 14 and 22 weeks gestation; 620 patients with IDDM had measurements of MSAFP of which 479 also had measurements of beta-HCG, allowing calculation of DS risk. Increased NTD risk was defined as MSAFP >2.5 MOM while increased DS risk was defined as a calculated risk > or =1/270. One IDDM patient delivered an infant with a NTD; it was not detected on serum screening. No infants were born with DS. Of the 620 patients with MSAFP determinations, 9 had values >2.5 MOM before adjustment. After upward adjustment, 7 additional patients were identified. Sixteen patients were identified at increased risk for DS before and after adjustment. Our data suggest that the 20% upward adjustment of MSAFP increases by 78%, the number of patients who would require further evaluation for NTD's. Although we were able to identify 620 women with IDDM who underwent serum screening for NTD, the low prevalence of NTD's did not allow us to demonstrate an increased detection rate. The effect of upward adjustment of MSAFP on the number of patients categorized at increased DS risk appears to be minimal.
