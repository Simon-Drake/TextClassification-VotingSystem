[Serum screening of pregnant women for fetal neural tube defects and Down syndrome; initial experiences in The Netherlands].
OBJECTIVE: To examine if, and if so, in what way, the maternal serum screening for fetal neural tube defects (NTD) and Down's syndrome (DS) in the Dutch decentralized obstetrical organization would be feasible and effective. DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: University Hospital Groningen. METHOD: Between October 1st 1990 and December 1st 1991 we determined the likelihood of a baby with a NTD and/or DS in 2580 pregnant women, at 15 to 20 weeks gestation, by serum screening. RESULTS: Five foetuses with DS were detected, as well as two with a NTD, one foetus with an omphalocele, and one with Turner's syndrome. One infant with a NTD and one with DS were not found prenatally. Of all 98 women of 36 years or older, 68 declined amniocentesis because their risk was lower than the age related risk. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal serum screening for NTD and DS is feasible and effective in principle. In a decentralized prenatal care system, special attention has to be paid to the time needed to report the results and to the completion of the follow-up. The detection rate of DS in pregnant women of 36 years or older remains almost the same, but a significant number of them decline prenatal diagnosis. An increased risk of foetal DS, determined by serum screening, should be added to the official list of indications for prenatal diagnosis in the Netherlands.
