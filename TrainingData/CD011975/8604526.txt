[The use of the screening of maternal serum factors for the prenatal diagnosis of fetal developmental defects and chromosomal diseases].
The association of the levels of alpha-fetoprotein and chorionic gonadotropin with congenital developmental defects and chromosomal abnormalities of fetus was studied. The correlation of elevated level of alpha-fetoprotein with defects of neuraxis, kidney and abdominal wall of fetus was shown. These data are used for screening of women with a high risk for Down's syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities.
