[Should we expand the indications for analysis of fetal chromosomes?].
The usual indications of amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis are briefly reviewed. Some situations which are note included in these usual indications are discussed: mothers of 34 years, young aunts of a trisomic child, patients with a previous aborted conceptus diagnosed as trisomic by histological examination of the placenta or tissue culture. It is anticipated that, if accepted, these "unusual" criteria would not overload a given laboratory with an excess of analysis, and would certainly relief anxiety of motivated couples.
