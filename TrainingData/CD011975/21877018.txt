[Analysis of the combined first trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities].
PURPOSE: to evaluate the performance of the combined first trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities in a group of the Brazilian population. METHODS: a retrospective study including pregnant women with single fetuses referred to a fetal medicine center to perform the first trimester screening that combines maternal age, nuchal translucency measurement and two maternal serum biochemical markers: free B-hCG and PAPP-A. To evaluate the performance of the test, the detection rate, specificity, negative and positive predicted values and false-positive rates were calculated, considering as high risk the cut-off value above 1 in 300. RESULTS: we studied 456 patients submitted to the test. Advanced maternal age above 35 years was observed in 36.2% of cases. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the study population was 2.2%. Twenty-one patients (4.6%) presented a high risk (above 1:300) by the combined test. Using this cut-off level, the detection rate of the test was 70% for all chromosomal abnormalities and 83.3% for trisomy 21, for a false-positive rate of 3.1%. CONCLUSIONS: the combined first trimester screening was effective to detect chromosomal abnormalities, mainly for trisomy 21, with low false-positive rates. The combined test contributed to decreasing the indication of an invasive test if we compare to maternal age alone as a risk factor.
