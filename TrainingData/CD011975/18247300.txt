[Evaluating the applicability of MoM in second trimester maternal serum to screening for Down's syndrome in Jiangsu province].
OBJECTIVE: To study the applicability of MultiCalc software to prenatal screening of Down's syndrome in Jiangsu province, China. METHODS: The gestational age-specific median of maternal serum marker was calculated by means of regression method. Regression functions for adjustment of Multiple of the Median (MoM) by weight were established for our own population. RESULTS: Before the adjustment by weight, the average level of alpha fetal protein(AFP) was 16% higher and the free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG) was 14% higher than those of the Caucasian in MultiCalc software respectively. But when the AFP and free beta-hCG results were converted to weight-adjusted MoM levels, the values were 0.99 and 1.02 respectively. The median of MoM of AFP and the free beta-hCG were 1.00 through the regression model of gestational age and weight adjustment. CONCLUSION: There was no difference of average weight-adjusted MoM levels between the Jiangsu population and the Caucasian, and the MultiCalc software was applicable to maternal serum screening for Down's syndrome of Jiangsu.
