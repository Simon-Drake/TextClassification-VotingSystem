Re-evaluation of risk for Down syndrome by means of the combined test in pregnant women of 35 years or more.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of combined test in pregnant women 35 years of age and over to detect fetal Down syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included 408 pregnant women of 35 years and over, who requested the combined test (nuchal translucency, PAPP-A, free beta hCG, maternal age, cut-off 1:250) before deciding whether to undergo amniocentesis. RESULTS: The test was positive in 66 women who then requested amniocentesis for fetal karyotype determination; the other women had a negative test and declined amniocentesis. False-positives increased with maternal age from 6.6% at 35 years to about 50% at 40 to 41 and 100% in women over 41. Six cases of Down syndrome and two cases of trisomy 18 were detected. Not a single case of Down syndrome or trisomy 18 was missed, and other chromosome abnormalities were detected as well. CONCLUSIONS: The application of the combined test reduced the need for invasive testing to only 14% of the studied pregnant population, without missing any of the fetuses with trisomy 21 or 18.
