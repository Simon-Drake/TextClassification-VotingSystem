[How to improve assisted reproductive techniques results? Biological aspects].
In spite of recent improvements in IVF, pregnancy rates remained dramatically low. Better criteria are therefore necessary to establish the viability of a transferable top quality embryo. Observation of both pronuclei patterns at the zygote stage and early cleavage appears to offer an additional prognostic tool, correlating with chromosomal status and IVF outcome. Developmental ability and morphological evaluation of the embryo on days 2-3 remains the most used and valid method of selection, even though it is not sufficient to select embryos with the higher implantation potential. Blastocyst culture is another possible strategy for selecting the ideal embryo with theoretical, reduced risk of aneuploidies, though not all major chromosomal aberrations are excluded by prolonged in-vitro-culture. Concerning micro-manipulation of embryo such as hatching or cleaning or cytoplasm transfer, only controversial data are still available. In the field of ART, recent meta-analysis could not conclude to a positive effect concerning hatching, blastocyst culture or systematic PGD-AS (preimplantation genetic diagnosis with aneuploidy screening). Beside the technological aspect, Quality Management System is of great importance. Staff development and monitoring of staff performance in the IVF laboratory has to be considered in the next future.
