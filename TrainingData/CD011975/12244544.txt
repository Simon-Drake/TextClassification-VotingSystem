Evidence for imprinting on chromosome 16: the effect of uniparental disomy on the outcome of mosaic trisomy 16 pregnancies.
Although a number of infants with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 16 (upd(16)mat) have been reported, the evidence for imprinting on chromosome 16 is not yet conclusive. To test the hypothesis that upd(16)mat has a distinct phenotype, which would support the existence of imprinted gene(s) on chromosome 16, statistical analysis was performed on a large series (n = 83) of mosaic trisomy 16 cases with molecular determination of uniparental disomy status. The incidence of upd(16)mat was 40%, which is consistent with the expected one third from random chromosome loss during trisomy rescue (P = 0.262). In pairwise comparisons, upd(16)mat was found to be associated with fetal growth restriction (P = 0.029) and with increased risk of major malformation (RR = 1.43; P = 0.053). Regression modeling showed that the effect of upd(16)mat on fetal/neonatal weight and malformation is independent of the degree of trisomy detected in the fetus. Regression modeling to control for the degree of trisomy detected in the placenta was not possible due to limited sample size. We conclude that upd(16)mat is associated with more severe growth restriction, and possibly, with higher risk of malformation. Our hypothesis is that imprinted gene(s) exist on chromosome 16 and that abnormal expression of these gene(s) in upd(16)mat cells during development results in decreased cell proliferation. Although we do not advocate prenatal testing for upd(16), studies on the long-term outcome of upd(16)mat neonates is necessary for counseling purposes.
