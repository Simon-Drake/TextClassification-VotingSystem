Very low alpha-fetoprotein in Down syndrome maternal serum screening.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the frequency of very low maternal serum AFP and to differentiate congenital AFP deficiency from those diseases known to be associated with low AFP. METHODS: AFP values below 2 microg/L and borderline values up to 3 microg/L were retrospectively analysed in 839 773 singleton pregnancies included in a programme for routine screening of trisomy 21 maternal serum markers. RESULTS: Serum AFP was undetectable (< or =2 microg/L) in 8 cases, giving a frequency of 1/105 000. The calculated risk of Down syndrome was > or =1/250 in 5 cases. Fetal karyotype was normal. Seven of these pregnancies went to term (39-41 weeks) uneventfully, and birth weight was normal (3050-4110 g). In the 8th case, fetal death occurred at 35 weeks due to severe maternal diabetes. AFP levels between 2.1 and 3.0 microg/L were noted in 7 other cases. The calculated risk of Down syndrome was > or =1/250 in 5 cases, and fetal karyotype was normal. Pregnancies went to term in 4 cases (33-41 weeks), and birth weight was normal (3000-3380 g). In 3 cases, low hCG (<0.6 MoM) was associated with low AFP, and fetal death occurred at 15 to 16 weeks. CONCLUSION: Once technical errors have been excluded (repeat assay in a second run, calcium assayed to exclude the interference of EDTA for fluorimetric methods, dilution to exclude interfering antibodies, running on an alternative analyser, checking a second sample), very low second-trimester maternal serum AFP should prompt ultrasound examination in order to check fetal viability. Congenital AFP deficiency, an extremely rare disorder (1/100 000), should be suspected. It has no consequences for fetal and infant development, and parents should be reassured.
