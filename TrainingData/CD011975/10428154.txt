Incidence of sperm aneuploidy in relation to semen characteristics and assisted reproductive outcome.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of sperm aneuploidy in men screened for infertility and identify any eventual relation with assisted reproductive outcome. DESIGN: Controlled prospective study. SETTING: University hospital-based IVF program. PATIENT(S): Infertile couples who were screened for sperm aneuploidy and evaluated for IVF treatment. INTERVENTION(S): Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to identify chromosomes 18, 21, X, and Y. The assisted reproductive techniques of IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection were used for infertility treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The incidence of sperm aneuploidy, semen parameters, fertilization rate, pregnancy characteristics, and rate of neonatal malformations were determined. RESULT(S): Oligozoospermic and teratozoospermic men had a significantly higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities than men with normal semen parameters (2.7% vs. 1.8%). The increased frequency of sperm aneuploidy did not appear to affect pregnancy losses or the occurrence of neonatal malformations. CONCLUSION(S): Suboptimal semen samples had a higher incidence of aneuploidy. In this study, the increased frequency of chromosomal abnormalities did not have a direct effect on the fertilization rate, pregnancy characteristics, or neonatal outcome.
