Inhibin A measurement using an automated assay platform.
BACKGROUND: Second-trimester measurement of maternal serum inhibin A is widely used for Down syndrome screening. To date, only a manual enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) produced by Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc (DSL) has been available. The objective of this study was to compare the DSL assay with a new automated assay produced by Beckman Coulter, Inc (Access). METHODS: Residual serum samples from 570 women, who were receiving routine screening for Down syndrome, were retrieved from storage. The Access assay sensitivity, linearity and reproducibility were determined and a method comparison was performed. Inhibin A levels were measured using both assays. Twenty samples from women with confirmed Down syndrome pregnancy were also tested. RESULTS: The Access assay had coefficients of variation of less than 10% across the range of values tested, and a sensitivity below 1 pg/mL. The DSL and Access inhibin A assay values were highly correlated (r = 0.961, r(2) = 0.923), with no apparent outliers. Inhibin A values from the Access assay were a constant 23% lower (95% CI 1-41%) than corresponding values from the DSL assay. Median values from 15 to 20 completed weeks' gestation were computed and found to be consistent with expectations. The weight-adjusted multiples of the median (MoM) levels in the unaffected pregnancies fit a log Gaussian distribution well between at least the 5th and 95th percentiles with corresponding log standard deviations of 0.1960 and 0.1919 for DSL and Access, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With median inhibin A levels appropriately calculated for the Access assay, Down syndrome screening performance is expected to be comparable to that obtained with the manual DSL assay.
