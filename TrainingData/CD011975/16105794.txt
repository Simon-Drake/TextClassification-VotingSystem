Frequency of echogenic intracardiac focus by race/ethnicity in euploid fetuses.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of echogenic intracardiac focus (EIF) by race/ethnicity. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis from January 1996 through June 2003. We reviewed all initial sonograms from 14 to 23 weeks gestation in singleton pregnancies. Mothers on admission for delivery provided race/ethnicity. RESULTS: There were 8207 ultrasounds and deliveries that met study criteria. There were 4636 (56.5%) Caucasian, 2087 (25.4%) African-American, 1261 (15.4%) Hispanic and 223 (2.7 %) Asian subjects. There were 347 (4.2%) EIF detected. The frequency by race/ethnicity varied significantly (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This large, population-based study showed that fetuses born to Asian mothers were significantly more likely to have an EIF. This racial difference should be taken into account when counseling patients about the potential for Down syndrome.
