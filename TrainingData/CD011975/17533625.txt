Could ovarian choriocarcinoma be detected by maternal serum screening for Down syndrome?
The incidence of ovarian malignancies during gestation ranges from 1 in 8000 to 1 in 20,000 deliveries. Ovarian malignancies that produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are limited to germ cell tumors, of which dysgerminoma is the most frequent (45%) malignant type encountered in pregnant patients, the others being ovarian choriocarcinoma and mixed germ cell tumors (Boulay and Podczaski, 1998). In women of childbearing age, it is hard to distinguish between metastatic choriocarcinoma on a complete mole and primary ovarian choriocarcinoma. Treatment is based on adnexectomy followed by chemotherapy. Given the extreme rarity of these tumors, the long-term prognosis is difficult to establish. Had the diagnosis for our patient been made during pregnancy, the therapeutic approach would have been discussed in terms of gestational age. In the last trimester, we could have suggested cesarean section followed by adnexectomy, and then chemotherapy. In the second-trimester, chemotherapy could have been discussed, although the fetal toxicity of cisplatin chemotherapy is not firmly defined (Ferrandina et al., 2005). This treatment is an alternative to termination of pregnancy. We retrospectively studied maternal serum biochemistry so as to assess the possibility of a diagnosis of ovarian choriocarcinoma at the time of maternal serum screening for Down syndrome.
