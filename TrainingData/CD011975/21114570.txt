Increased pulsatility of the ductus venosus blood velocity in the first trimester is associated with the delivery of small for gestational age or low birth weight infants.
AIM: To determine the relationship between ultrasound findings during the first trimester and obstetrical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out on 516 women who underwent ultrasound examination between 12 and 14 gestational weeks. RESULTS: The reduced crown-rump length, biparietal diameter, femur length (Z-score < -1 and -1.5) and increased umbilical artery pulsatility index (>90th and 95th percentile) were not associated with poor obstetrical outcomes. A ductus venosus pulsatility index greater than the 90th percentile was associated with aneuploidy, small for gestational age and low birth weight infants. CONCLUSION: Increased pulsatility in the ductus venosus is associated with increased risk for chromosomal abnormality in early pregnancy. Here we show that increased pulsatility is also linked to fetal growth restriction.
