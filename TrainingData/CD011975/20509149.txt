QF-PCR as a stand-alone test for prenatal samples: the first 2 years' experience in the London region.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the results of the first 2 years of a QF-PCR stand-alone testing strategy for the prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidy in the London region and to determine the advantages and disadvantages of this policy. METHODS: A review of the results of 9737 prenatal samples received for exclusion of chromosome abnormalities. All samples were subjected to QF-PCR testing for common aneuploidies but only samples fulfilling specific criteria subsequently had a full karyotype analysis. RESULTS: Of the 9737 samples received, 10.3% had a chromosome abnormality detected by QF-PCR testing. Of the 7284 samples received with no indication for karyotype analysis, 25 (0.3%) received a normal QF-PCR result but subsequently had an abnormal karyotype detected either prenatally as a privately funded test or postnatally. Of these samples, without subsequent abnormal ultrasound findings, five had a chromosome abnormality associated with a poor prognosis, representing 0.069% of samples referred for Down syndrome testing. CONCLUSION: While back-up karyotyping is required for some samples, using QF-PCR as a stand-alone prenatal test for pregnancies without ultrasound abnormalities reduces costs, provides rapid delivery of results, and avoids ambiguous and uncertain karyotype results, reducing parental anxiety.
