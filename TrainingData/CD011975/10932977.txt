Dimeric inhibin A as a fourth marker for Down's syndrome maternal serum screening in native Japanese women.
OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the usefulness of dimeric inhibin A as a fourth marker for Down's syndrome screening in addition to AFP, hCG and uE3 markers for native Japanese women. METHODS: Serum specimens from 367 native Japanese women in the second trimester were assayed for dimeric inhibin A levels. Day specific dimeric inhibin A medians were established for gestational ages 15.0-21.9. Weekly median values for the native Japanese were compared with those of a U.S. population. Selected Japanese specimens from 15 diagnosed Down's syndrome and 3 trisomy 18 cases were also assayed for dimeric inhibin A. RESULTS: Dimeric inhibin A levels did not vary greatly over the gestational age range as expected. Median value comparison showed that native Japanese dimeric inhibin A medians are higher than the U.S. population medians by an average of 7.95%. Native Japanese dimeric inhibin A median values in this study are 1.77 times higher in Down's syndrome cases than in unaffected pregnancies. Trisomy 18 dimeric inhibin A levels show no significant difference from the unaffected pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows for the first time that dimeric inhibin A can be informative as a fourth marker for Down's syndrome screening in native Japanese women. We expect the addition of dimeric inhibin A to a triple marker protocol will increase the accuracy of predicted risk for all pregnancies screened and increase the detection rate of Down's syndrome affected pregnancies.
