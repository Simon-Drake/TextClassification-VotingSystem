Is there any effect of fetal gender on the markers of first trimester Down's syndrome screening?
INTRODUCTION: At present, the most effective trisomy 21-screening method is the estimate of risk combining maternal age, fetal nuchal translucency, beta-hCG and pregnancy-associated PAPP-A. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effect of fetal gender in first trimester Down's syndrome screening markers. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Prenatal Diagnosis Centre in a tertiary hospital in Lagos. METHODS: Of a total of 350 pregnancies in which fetal nuchal translucency and maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A were performed were included in this study. These markers were investigated to see if they differed on the basis of fetal gender. RESULTS: PAPP-A levels were higher in female fetuses although the difference was not statistically significant. Nuchal translucency was 0.099 mm more in male fetuses. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that first trimester markers differ on gender but are of no clinical significance, confirming the result of other authors.
