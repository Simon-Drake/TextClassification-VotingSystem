The effect of image size on screen-positive rates for nuchal translucency screening.
It has been shown previously that the absolute measurement of nuchal translucency (NT) thickness, one of the most effective screening tests for fetal Down syndrome, significantly decreases with increasing image size. We undertook a prospective study to assess whether this effect materially alters the NT-derived risk estimation for fetal Down syndrome. In 350 women, NT was measured at both 100 and 200% image sizes. The median NT measurement at 200% was 8% smaller than at 100%. The screen-positive rates at 100 and 200% image sizes were 5.1% (18/350) and 2.3% (8/350), respectively (P= 0.048). Altering the image magnification settings is likely to decrease the sensitivity of NT-derived Down syndrome risk estimation. Further study is required to test the effect of our finding on the sensitivity of NT screening and to assess whether adjustments in gain settings mitigate the effect.
