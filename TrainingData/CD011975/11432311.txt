Combined measurement of fetal nuchal translucency, maternal serum free beta-hCG, and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A for first-trimester Down's syndrome screening.
PURPOSE: It has been proposed that first-trimester Down's syndrome screening has a higher detection rate compared to second-trimester biochemical screening. This study investigated the accuracy of Down's syndrome screening during gestational weeks 10 to 13 using the combination of fetal nuchal translucency (NT) measurement with maternal serum concentrations of free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). METHODS: A total of 1,514 women with singleton pregnancies were enrolled in this study. Fetal NT was measured using the criteria published by the Fetal Medicine Foundation. Maternal serum concentrations of free beta-hCG and PAPP-A were determined by microtiter-plate ELISA. Down's syndrome risk was calculated using multivariate Gaussian distribution and Alpha software. RESULTS: Seventeen (1.12%) of the 1514 screened pregnancies had a fetal NT of at least 3 mm, and 41.2% of these had a poor pregnancy outcome, including four fetal aneuploidies. The odds of a fetal aneuploidy when the NT was greater than 2.0 multiples of median (MoM) was 90, when serum PAPP-A concentration was less than 0.45 MoM, it was 8.6, and when serum free beta-hCG concentration was greater than 2.2 MoM, it was 4.7. Using a risk cut-off level of 1 in 400, nine of 10 fetal aneuploidies were identified with a 4.7% false-positive rate, including two with trisomy 21, one with trisomy 18, and three with Turner's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that Down's syndrome screening using the combined test in the first trimester had a higher detection rate than that of serum screening in the second trimester. Implementation of NT measurement in the first trimester provides substantial advantages for Down's syndrome detection and early diagnosis of fetal structural abnormalities.
