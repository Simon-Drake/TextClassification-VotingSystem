Prenatal diagnosis of a true fetal tetraploidy in direct and cultured chorionic villi.
Prenatal diagnosis of a true fetal tetraploidy in direct and cultured chorionic villi: Tetraploidy is characterized by four complete sets of chromosomes (4n= 92). Although it has been frequently reported in spontaneous abortions, tetraploidy is extremely rare in term pregnancy. Most of late surviving patients are diploid/tetraploid mosaics and present severe mental and physical impairment. Up to date, only five tetraploidies were ascertained in the prenatal stage in amniocytes and/or fetal blood lymphocytes. No one has been reported in chorionic villi probably because tetraploidy is generally considered in this tissue as a false positive result due to confined placental mosaicism (CPM) or placental culture artefacts. We report here on a case of tetraploidy detected in chorionic villi because of fetal cystic hygroma. We discuss the reliability of this diagnosis and propose guidelines in the follow-up of tetraploidies detected after chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Thus a misdiagnosis of this poor condition will be avoided at best and an appropriate genetic counseling will be given to the parents.
