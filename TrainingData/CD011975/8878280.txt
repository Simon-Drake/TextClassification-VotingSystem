Triple marker screening in native Japanese women.
Prenatal screening using the maternal serum markers alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated oestriol was investigated in a native Japanese population. Comparison with a Caucasian U.S. population revealed differences which led to modification of the generally used equations for risk calculations. Prenatal screening was shown to be clinically useful.
