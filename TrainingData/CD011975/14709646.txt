Invasive trophoblast antigen (hyperglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin) in second-trimester maternal urine as a marker for down syndrome: preliminary results of an observational study on fresh samples.
BACKGROUND: Down syndrome screening is commonly performed in the US using maternal age and three or four second-trimester maternal serum markers that can identify up to 75% of affected pregnancies by offering diagnostic studies to 5% of women. Invasive trophoblast antigen [ITA; hyperglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)] is a promising marker that can be measured in urine or serum in the first or second trimester. We report preliminary results for urinary ITA in an ongoing observational study. METHODS: Women undergoing second-trimester amniocentesis for reasons not associated with biochemical testing provided consent and a urine (and possibly serum) sample that was tested within a few days. Demographic and pregnancy-related information was collected, along with karyotype. Screening performance was modeled for ITA alone and in combination with serum markers RESULTS: Twelve recruitment centers collected urine from 2055 women with singleton pregnancies between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation (2023 unaffected, 28 Down syndrome, and 4 pregnancies with other chromosome abnormalities). After correction for gestational age, urine concentration, and maternal race and weight, the ITA measurements were higher in women with a Down syndrome pregnancy (median ITA, 4.33 multiples of the median). At a 75% detection rate, the false-positive rate could be reduced by substituting ITA for hCG measurements (from 5.6% to 2.6% for the triple test) or by adding ITA measurements to existing combinations (from 3.3% to 2.0% for the quadruple test). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide preliminary confirmation of the potential usefulness of urinary ITA measurements in detecting Down syndrome in a setting that simulates routine usage.
