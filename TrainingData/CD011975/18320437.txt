Live birth following preimplantation genetic screening for trisomy 21. Should aneuploidy screening be offered to all older patients undergoing IVF?
A 42-year-old female patient with history of secondary infertility was referred to our assisted conception unit for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Before her referral, she had two cycles of IVF at another centre; the first was unsuccessful and, after conceiving at the second attempt, the pregnancy was terminated at 14 weeks' gestation following a positive nuchal translucency scan and a diagnosis of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) by a chorionic villous biopsy performed in the first trimester. The screening tests for trisomy 21 were offered to the patient in view of her advanced age. Subsequent karyotyping revealed that both partners had a normal chromosomal complement. Following genetic counselling, the couple were offered IVF treatment along with preimplantation genetic screening for trisomy 21. Four of the five embryos were suitable for biopsy, and one blastomere from each embryo was analyzed using fluorescent in situ hybridization for chromosome 21. The analysis revealed that two embryos had trisomy 21, one had monosomy 21, and only one embryo was diploid for chromosome 21. The single diploid embryo was transferred to the uterus on day 3, and resulted in an uneventful pregnancy and delivery of a healthy live-born male.
