Monitoring meiosis in gametogenesis.
Meiotic recombination is essential to hold homologous chromosomes together so that they can separate accurately in the formation of gametes, thus preventing fetal loss due to aneuploidy. How do germ cells know when they have finished genetic recombination and that it is time to enter the meiotic division phase, and what are the elements that signal the onset of the division phase? During spermatogenesis there is no arrest at the end of meiotic prophase (as there is in oogenesis) and signals for progress into the meiotic division phase may be closely related to events of chromosome pairing and recombination. Methods for culture of male germ cells have been used to show that spermatocytes become competent for some aspects of the division phase by the early pachytene stage, long before they would normally enter division. Evidence suggests that establishment of homologous chromosome pairing is one aspect of acquiring competence. Activation of the cell cycle regulator MPF also appears to be important, and there is a requirement for activity of topoisomerase II in order for spermatocytes to exit prophase and enter the meiotic division phase. Understanding how these molecular entities tie into monitoring the completion of recombination and meiotic progress will be instructive about important gametic safeguards preventing aberrant chromosome segregation and resultant aneuploidy.
