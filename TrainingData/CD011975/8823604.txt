Maternal serum triple analyte screening and adverse pregnancy outcome.
The prognostic value of maternal serum triple analyte screening with AFP, hCG and uE3 (unconjugated estriol) was studied early in the second trimester of pregnancy. In this case-control study of 38 women and 76 matched controls derived from a consecutive screened population of 28,897, case selection was based upon elevated MSAFP and MShCG (> or = 2 MOM) and low MSuE3 (< or = 0.6 MOM). Adverse pregnancy outcome was found in 65.8% of cases and 2.6% of controls (RR 25, 95% CI 6.3-100.0). When increased odds (> or = 1 in 270) for Down's syndrome were considered with the abnormal analyte screen, fetal/congenital defects, fetal neonatal loss or low birth weight were noted in 17/26 cases (65.4%). Elevated MSAFP and MShCG with low values for estriol, with or without increased odds for Down's syndrome, imply an unfavorable prognosis for both the fetus and the child.
