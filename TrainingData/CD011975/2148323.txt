Abnormal embryonic heart rate pattern in early pregnancy associated with Down's syndrome.
The case history of a 35-year-old woman with a pregnancy following IVF treatment is presented. Transvaginal sonography revealed an abnormal pattern of the embryonic heart rate between 28 and 50 days following follicular aspiration. At term, a male infant with the characteristics of Down's syndrome was born. The diagnosis was confirmed by chromosome analysis. The implications of this observation are discussed.
