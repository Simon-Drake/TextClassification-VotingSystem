How accurate is the prenatal diagnosis of abnormal genitalia?
PURPOSE: The prenatal diagnosis of abnormal genitalia may have a major impact on prenatal counseling and postnatal outcome. We studied the accuracy and clinical implications of the prenatal diagnosis of abnormal genitalia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 1999 the prenatal and/or postnatal diagnosis of abnormal genitalia in 53 cases was made at our institution. All cases were prenatally assessed at our Obstetrics and Fetal Medicine Department. Outcome was confirmed postnatally or by a fetopathologist in the case of pregnancy termination. RESULTS: A genital anomaly was prenatally diagnosed in 43 cases and was accurate in 34, while in 9 cases anomalies were absent at birth. In 10 cases ambiguous genitalia were not detected prenatally. The primary anomalies suspected were male pseudohermaphroditism in 19 cases and female pseudohermaphroditism in 12, including 2 cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Male pseudohermaphroditism was detected prenatally in 17 cases and diagnosis was confirmed at birth. Female pseudohermaphroditism was detected prenatally in 12 cases and only 5 were confirmed and the anomaly was discovered at birth in 6. The prognosis was highly altered when many malformations or aneuploidy was associated with ambiguous genitalia. Of the 15 patients with many malformations only 3 survived, and pregnancy was terminated in 3 of 4 cases of aneuploidy. CONCLUSIONS: When pseudohermaphroditism was detected in a male fetus by an experienced ultrasonographer at a tertiary center the prenatal diagnosis was accurate in 100% of cases. The prenatal diagnosis was less accurate (46% correct) in a female fetus.
