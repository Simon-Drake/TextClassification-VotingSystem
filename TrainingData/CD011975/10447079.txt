First trimester umbilical venous Doppler sonography in chromosomally normal and abnormal fetuses.
In 342 singleton pregnancies in which the patients were undergoing chorionic villus sampling at 11 to 14 weeks of gestation, color Doppler sonography was used to obtain waveforms from the umbilical cord. The prevalence of pulsatile flow in the umbilical vein was higher in the 18 fetuses with trisomy 18 or 13 (16 of 18; 88.9%) than in the 18 fetuses with trisomy 21 (6 of 18; 33.3%) or the 302 chromosomally normal fetuses (73 of 302; 24.2%).
