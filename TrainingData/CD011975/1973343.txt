Study of the parental origin of sexual aneuploidy in ten families using RFLPs.
We have studied 10 families with sexual aneuploidy by means of recombinant DNA techniques. The X linked probes were F814 (DXS52), FIX (FVIII gene), pert 87.15 (DXS164), L754 (DXS84) and 47Z (DXYS5). The observed banding patterns allowed us to determine the parental origin of such aneuploidy in nine of our cases. It was paternal in seven cases and maternal in two.
