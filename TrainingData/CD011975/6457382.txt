Familial Down's syndrome.
Investigation of an intensely consanguinized family in which three children were born with Down's syndrome (in one of them the diagnosis was uncertain) suggests the existence of a gene that favours chromosomal non-disjunction. In the same family there were two children with multiple malformations and two with neoplasia.
