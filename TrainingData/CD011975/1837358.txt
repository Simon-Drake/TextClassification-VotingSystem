Ultrasound diagnosis of fetal abnormalities and cytogenetic evaluation.
Over a 6 1/2 year period, in 288 pregnancies a variety of fetal malformations were detected by ultrasound. Two hundred and ten fetuses (73 per cent) were karyotyped. Gestational age at detection ranged from 11 to 38 weeks. The incidence of an abnormal karyotype in the total series was 14 per cent and 14.7 per cent in the 210 pregnancies in which a karyotype was performed. Single structural anomalies were found in 149 cytogenetically investigated fetuses, of which 25 had a chromosomal abnormality (17 per cent). Multiple structural malformations were present in 61 fetuses, of which 16 had an abnormal karyotype (26 per cent). Trisomy 18 was the most frequent finding. The most constant ultrasound finding in cases of an abnormal karyotype was polyhydramnios and severe IUGR in combination with structural defects. There is a need for extensive detailed ultrasound examination in high-risk pregnancies.
