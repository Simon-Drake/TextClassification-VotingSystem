[Correlation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 12 level in maternal serum during the first trimester with pregnancy outcome].
OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between pregnant outcomes and the maternal serum level of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 12 (ADAM 12) in the first trimester. METHODS: From July 2007 to January 2008, the serum levels of ADAM 12 of 511 women in their first trimester (6 - 13 gestational weeks), who attended the clinics at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, were tested by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Immunoassay (TR-FIA), and the results and pregnant outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) The median levels of ADAM 12 at 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 weeks of gestation were 14.63 microg/L, 35.08 microg/L, 88.90 microg/L, 186.51 microg/L, 370.62 microg/L, 537.71 microg/L, 632.55 microg/L, and 769.42 microg/L, respectively, showing a linear increase with the gestational age (r =0. 992, P < 0.01). (2) Among the 511 pregnancies, 427 were normal singleton term pregnancies and 84 had adverse perinatal outcomes. Twenty-seven miscarriages (5.3%, 27/511) and 5 ectopic pregnancies were reported and the Multiple of Medians (MOM) of them were 0.24 and 0.32, respectively, which was significantly lower than the normal singleton pregnancies (1.01, P < 0.05). However, the serum level of ADAM 12 in 5 women with placenta previa (MOM = 1.45) was significantly higher than the normal ones (P < 0.05). No significant correlation was found between the fetal birth weight and maternal serum level of ADAM 12 in the first trimester (r = -0.15, P < 0.05). (3) Thirteen cases with chromosomal abnormalities was identified out of 97 cases who received fetal karyotyping, including 3 Down's syndrome and 2 Turner syndrome, and the MOM of ADAM 12 in these 13 cases (0.34) was significantly different from those normal singleton pregnancies (P < 0.05). MoMs of ADAM 12 in 10 euchromosome aneupolyhaploids cases (0.29)were lower than the normal ones (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The maternal serum level of ADAM 12 in the first-trimester is a potential marker for aneupolyhaploid screening and early fetal loss prediction, and is suggested to be tested at 9-12 gestational weeks as part of prenatal screening.
