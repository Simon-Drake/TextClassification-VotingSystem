Single and multiple umbilical cord cysts in early gestation: two different entities.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of single and multiple umbilical cord cysts in the first trimester and to assess whether there is a difference in the pregnancy outcome between them. METHODS: A targeted sonographic morphological and morphometric evaluation of the umbilical cord was performed in consecutive patients between 7 and 14 weeks of gestation. Crown-rump length and umbilical cord diameter were measured in all cases. Nuchal translucency thickness was measured between 11 and 14 weeks' gestation. In pregnancies at very early gestational ages (7-10 weeks) an additional scan was performed between 11 and 14 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 1159 patients was screened. The prevalence of umbilical cord cysts was 2.1% (24/1159). The cysts were single and multiple in 18 and six cases, respectively. The median (range) largest umbilical cord cyst diameter was no different between multiple and single umbilical cord cysts (3.8 (2.1-18) mm vs. 3.05 (2.0-7.8) mm; P = 0.386). All women with a single umbilical cord cyst delivered an infant without structural abnormalities and without features suggestive of chromosomal abnormalities. Among the women with multiple umbilical cord cysts, four had a missed miscarriage and one had a fetus with obstructive uropathy. CONCLUSION: Single and multiple umbilical cord cysts in the first trimester of gestation represent two different entities. While single cysts in the first trimester are associated with a favorable pregnancy outcome, the presence of multiple umbilical cord cysts is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and aneuploidy.
