Costs of NHS maternity care for women with multiple pregnancy compared with high-risk and low-risk singleton pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare antenatal and obstetric costs for multiple pregnancy versus singleton pregnancy risk groups and to identify factors driving cost differentials. DESIGN: Observational study over 15 months (2001-02). SETTING: Four district hospitals in southeast England. POPULATION: Consecutive women with multiple pregnancy and singleton women with risk factors for fetal congenital heart disease (CHD) (pregestational diabetes, epilepsy, or family history of CHD) or Down syndrome, and a sample of low-risk singleton women. METHODS: Clinical care was audited from the second trimester anomaly scan until postnatal discharge, and the resource items were costed. Multiple regression analysis determined predictors of costs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: NHS mean costs of antenatal and obstetric care for different types of pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 959 pregnancies were studied. Three percent of 243 women with multiple pregnancy reached 40 weeks of gestation compared with 54-55% of 163 low-risk and 322 Down syndrome risk women and 36% of 231 cardiac risk women. Antenatal costs for cardiac risk (1,153 pounds sterling) and multiple pregnancy (1,048 pounds sterling) were nearly double the costs for other two groups (P < 0.001). As 63% of multiple births were delivered by caesarean section, the obstetric cost for multiple pregnancy (3,393 pounds sterling) was 1,000 pounds sterling greater overall. Pregestational diabetes was the most influential factor driving singleton costs, resulting in similar total costs for multiple pregnancy women (4,442 pounds sterling) and for women with diabetes (4,877 pounds sterling). CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses confirm that multiple pregnancies are substantially more costly than most singleton pregnancies. Identifying women with diabetes as equally costly is pertinent because of the findings of the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health that standards of maternal care for diabetics often are inadequate.
