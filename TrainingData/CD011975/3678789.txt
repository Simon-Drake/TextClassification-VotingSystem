[Chorionic villi (placental) biopsy in the 2d and 3d trimester: new perspectives in prenatal diagnosis].
A report of our first experience in second and third trimester chorionic villus (placental) biopsy is given. In all 16 cases a cytogenetic result could be received within 2 to 5 days. There were 6 normal female and 9 normal male karyotypes. A third trimester CVS showed a mosaicism of a structural aberration of chromosome 9 (46, XX/46, XX, 9p+). Blood cultures of the fetus revealed a normal female karyotype. The following indications of a second and third trimester CVS are discussed: direct or indirect signs of fetal malformations in ultrasound scanning (Oligo- or Anhydramnios with severe intrauterine growth retardation), placental anomalies (exclusion of triploidies), non immunologic hydrops fetalis, low serum alpha FP and failed amniotic fluid culture. We believe that transabdominal CVS in the second and third trimester is a simple and rapid tool to exclude distinctively any chromosomal anomaly and therefore influences further management of pregnancy and parturition.
