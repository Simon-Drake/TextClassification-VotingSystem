Log-linear allometry of fetal craniofacial growth in Down's syndrome.
Trisomy 21 develops as a result of nondisjunction of two homologous chromosomes during either the first or second meiotic division. One of the more important consequences of these genetic alterations is the predictable, although variable disturbance in the architecture of the craniofacial region [1]. Postnatal craniofacial morphology has been extensively studied in Down's syndrome (DS). However, little information is available on human prenatal development of the head and face in such patients. The time at which changes in craniofacial phenotype first emerge in Down's syndrome fetuses and at which physical growth begins to diverge from normal is unknown. To explore these questions, we compared prenatal craniofacial growth in 50 Down's syndrome fetuses with that of 555 fetuses judged to be "typical for body weight and age" using the method of log-linear allometry [2].
