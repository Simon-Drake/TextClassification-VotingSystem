[The prenatal diagnosis of Down's syndrome based on the biochemical screening of maternal serum markers].
The role of maternal alpha-fetoprotein and chorionic gonadotprin screening in complex prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome had been studied. The average markers' values in cases of fetus trisomy 21 were 0.67 MoM (AFP) and 2.68 MoM (HGG). The correlative dependence between the markers' levels in trisomy 21 and the date of testing have been found. The high efficiency of differentiative approach to invasive investigations in the older age group of pregnant (above 35 years old) on the basis of AFP and HGG screening has been established.
