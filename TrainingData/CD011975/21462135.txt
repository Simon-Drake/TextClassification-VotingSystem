[Rapid and high-throughput multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for diagnosis of chromosome aneuploidy].
OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for detection of common chromosome aneuploidy in amniotic fluid (AF) cells in order to obtain an accurate, rapid, cost-effective and high-throughput method in routine prenatal clinical practice. METHODS: The MLPA test was performed on 500 AF samples by using kit P095 and the results were obtained by using analysis software RH-MLPA-v511. The results were compared with that from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and traditional karyotyping (TK). The technical critical issues were analyzed in routine diagnostic application. RESULTS: The absolute specificity and sensitivity of the MLPA test to detect the aneuploidy were 100%. For the 500 AF samples, the success rate of the MLPA tests was 97%. Among them 92% were finished within three working days and 5% required more days for repeating. The test failure rate was 3%. The results confirmed that for the 38 detectable aneuploid samples, the probe reliability weighted mean ratio values were more than 4SD compared to normal diploids and the 2 suspected trisomy samples were more than 2SD. In this study, authors analyzed hybridization efficiencies of 8 probes for chromosome 21, and the presence of a trisomy was considered if at least 4 of the 8 probes gave probe ratio of >1.3. CONCLUSION: Thedata suggested that MLPA is a rapid, simple and reliable method for large scale testing for aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, or Y in AF. The MLPA technology is complementary to AF culture and valuable for prenatal diagnosis.
