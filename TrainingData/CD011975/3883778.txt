Spermicidal contraceptives and poor reproductive outcomes: the epidemiologic evidence against an association.
The first widely publicized report of an association between spermicidal contraception and congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion had considerable impact on obstetric practice. A large number of more recent epidemiologic studies have generally failed to support the earlier finding, and it is concluded that no such association has been demonstrated. The available evidence precludes the need for additional regulation of spermicidal contraception.
