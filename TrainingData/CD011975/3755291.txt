A computer model for the study of segregation in reciprocal translocation carriers: application to 20 new cases.
We report on a computer program that, given the breakpoints and the chromosomes involved in a translocation, generates all the possible imbalanced gametes, calculates their corresponding imbalances, and arranges them in order of increasing imbalance. When compared to current, more cumbersome criteria from the literature, both methods agreed on 196 cases of 199 (greater than 98%). When compared to observed data from families with aneuploid offspring, both our program and the other reported methods yield a rate of accurate prediction of 87%. The use of the program is illustrated in 20 new translocations from our laboratory. The possible influence of crossing over in meiosis I in altering the gamete that is most likely to be passed to aneuploid live births is discussed.
