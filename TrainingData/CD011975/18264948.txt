Maternal serum ADAM12s as a potential marker of trisomy 21 prior to 10 weeks of gestation.
BACKGROUND: ADAM12s (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) is a placenta-derived glycoprotein that is involved in growth and differentiation and has been shown to be a potential first-trimester and second-trimester marker of trisomy 21 and other aneuploides. Maternal ADAM12s concentrations show a considerable temporal variation with gestational age and in the initial study levels were found to be significantly reduced in the early first trimester. Here we study the levels prior to 10 weeks of gestation to establish further the effectiveness or otherwise of ADAM12s as an early screening marker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples collected as part of routine first-trimester screening were retrieved from storage. In total, ten samples from singleton pregnancies with trisomy 21 were identified and were collected between the 8th and 9th weeks of gestation-of these 80% had been identified by combined first-trimester screening. A series of 62 gestational age-matched samples from singleton pregnancies collected during the same period formed the control group. ADAM12s was measured by a new DELFIA assay incorporating two monoclonals (6E6 and 8F8). Results were expressed as multiples of the median (MoM). RESULTS: The median MoM ADAM12s at a median gestation of 9.3 weeks was 0.61 which was significantly lower than in the controls (p = 0.011) when compared by the Mann-Whitney test. The corresponding median pregnancy associated plasma protein (PAPP-A) was 0.30 and free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) 2.02. CONCLUSIONS: Combining the data from this study and from the only other published study with data prior to 10 weeks suggests that ADAM12s may have the potential as an early screening marker for trisomy 21, but may not be as reduced as first thought.
