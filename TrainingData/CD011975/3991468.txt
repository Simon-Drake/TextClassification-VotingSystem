Prenatal diagnosis of a true mosaic trisomy 20 substantiated by demonstration of a gene dosage effect for adenosine deaminase (ADA).
Fibroblasts from a fetus with the prenatal diagnosis of mosaic trisomy 20 were cloned by dilution plating. Adenosine deaminase (ADA), a biochemical marker for chromosome 20, was assayed in trisomic clones and normal clones as control. The cytogenetic diagnosis was substantiated by demonstration of a triplex gene dosage effect for ADA in the trisomic cells.
