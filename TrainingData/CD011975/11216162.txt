[Prenatal diagnosis in twin pregnancy].
There are some unique problems of prenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling of twins, although methods of evaluation are similar in multiply and singleton pregnancies. Indications, risk and complications of this techniques were described. Also sensitivity and specificity of biochemic screening examination were compared between singleton and multiply pregnancy. Prenatal diagnosis based on amniopunction and chorionbiopsy seems to be safe and useful method determining aneuploidy. The risk of this methods is higher in twins than in singleton pregnancies. Although, in twin pregnancies, it is related rather to higher complications rate, than to procedures pregnancies losses.
