Congenital malformations and maternal smoking during pregnancy.
The relationship between smoking during pregnancy and congenital malformations was studied in prospective studies of 33,434 live births in the Kaiser-Permanente Birth Defects Study and 53,512 live births in the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP). In the Kaiser study, statistically significant positive associations (P less than .05) were observed for ventral hernias, omphaloceles, and "other major gut abnormalities," but, for each comparison the estimates were based on one or two unexposed cases. Statistically significant negative associations were found for ventricular septal defects (odds ratio, 0.5 [95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.96]), hydroceles (0.7 [0.6-0.9]), clubfoot (0.7 [0.6-0.9]), pigmented nevi (0.7 [0.6-0.9]), hemangiomas (0.8[0.7-0.98]) and Down syndrome (0.2 [0.1-0.9]). To determine if the findings noted above were an artifact of multiple comparisons, seven of these nine malformations were analyzed by smoking status for women in the CPP. All but one of the associations were not confirmed in the CPP. Previously described associations between smoking and specific congenital malformations were also tested using data from the CPP. We conclude that smoking is unlikely to be responsible for a large increase in malformations at birth.
