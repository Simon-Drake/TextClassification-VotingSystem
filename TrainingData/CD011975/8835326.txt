Trisomy 3 mosaicism on CVS: case report with literature review and propositions for investigation and counseling.
Chorionic villus sampling performed for advanced maternal age revealed trisomy 3 in 20% of mitoses studied after a semi-direct chromosomal harvest. Amniocytes and cord blood showed a non-mosaic 46,XY karyotype. The birthweight of the normal newborn was at the tenth percentile. Analysis of term placenta by cytogenetics and by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the presence of the trisomy 3 in 20% and 12%, respectively, of cells from two peripheral placental biopsies. Placental histology was heterogeneous, some portions showing immature, edematous and undervascularized villi. DNA analysis confirmed the biparental origin of the chromosomes 3 in the child, whose development is normal at 36 months.
