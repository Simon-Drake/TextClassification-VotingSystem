Prenatal biochemical screening for Down's syndrome and neural tube defects.
Antenatal serum screening for Down's syndrome is now becoming established in many centers throughout the world. The screening method is based on the measurement of alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated estriol, and human chorionic gonadotropin between 15 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. These measurements, used in conjunction with a woman's age, provide risk estimates of having a pregnancy with Down's syndrome for every woman screened. By identifying the 5% of women with highest risk and offering them an amniocentesis, about 60% of Down's syndrome pregnancies can be identified. If an ultrasound scan examination is used routinely to estimate gestational age, the detection rate can be increased by 5% to 10%. Recent information on the distribution of the three serum markers in twin pregnancies and pregnancies with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus now means that screening can be carried out in such pregnancies. Various other serum markers of Down's syndrome have been reported, but at present they do not have a place in routine antenatal screening for Down's syndrome. The role of amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase measurement, alone and in combination with amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein measurement, in the antenatal diagnosis of open neural tube defects has recently been clarified. The best policy is to perform an amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein measurement as the primary test and an acetylcholinesterase determination for those women who have an amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein measurement of two times the normal median or greater. The acetylcholinesterase can be measured either by the standard method (gel electrophoresis) or by a new quantitative monoclonal antibody method.
