Early amniocentesis--a cytogenetic evaluation of over 1500 cases.
We report our cytogenetic experience of 1554 early amniocenteses between weeks 11 and 14 of gestation, of which 44 per cent were performed prior to week 14. The mean culture time was 14.5 days. Karyotyping was successful in 99.7 per cent of cases. In 9.9 per cent of cases, there was pseudomosaicism with a high rate of loss of an X-chromosome and structural aberration of chromosome 1, which may be due to the Chang medium. The mosaic rate was 0.5 per cent. The overall aberration rate was 2.8 per cent. Our data confirm the reliability of early amniocentesis, which is a serious alternative to standard amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS).
