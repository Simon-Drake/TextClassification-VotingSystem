Birth of a healthy girl after ICSI with ejaculated spermatozoa from a man with non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome.
Klinefelter's syndrome is a major contributor to male infertility. Recent reports of births after ICSI with especially testicular spermatozoa from infertile men with this syndrome are promising. The birth of a healthy girl after ICSI treatment with ejaculated spermatozoa from a man with non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome is reported. The non-mosaic karyotype was confirmed by chromosome analysis of both peripheral blood leukocytes and fibroblasts from a skin biopsy. In conclusion, in a very few cases, men with apparently non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome have ejaculated spermatozoa that can result in a birth of a healthy child following ICSI.
