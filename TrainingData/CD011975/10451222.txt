Development and characterization of antibodies to a nicked and hyperglycosylated form of hCG from a choriocarcinoma patient: generation of antibodies that differentiate between pregnancy hCG and choriocarcinoma hCG.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) exists in blood and urine as a variety of isoforms one of which contains peptide bond cleavages within its beta-subunit loop 2 and is referred to as nicked hCG (hCGn). This hCG isoform appears to be more prevalent in the urine of patients with certain malignancies and possibly in some disorders of pregnancy. Until now, only indirect immunoassays could be used to quantify hCGn. We report the development of two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to a form of hCGn isolated from a choriocarcinoma patient. This hCG isoform was not only 100% nicked, but also contained 100% tetrasaccharide-core O-linked carbohydrate moieties in its beta COOH-terminal region. Two-site immunometric assays have been developed using these new antibodies, B151 and B152. The former exhibits good specificity for hCGn independent of the source of the hCGn, the form excreted by choriocarcinoma patients or the form of hCGn from normal pregnancies. The latter antibody, B152, is sensitive to the carbohydrate moieties and possibly other differences in hCG isoforms, but is not for nicking of the beta-subunit. These two immunometric assays provide potential novel diagnostic tools for direct measurement of hCG isoforms which could not be accurately quantified earlier before development of the assays using these newly generated antibodies.
