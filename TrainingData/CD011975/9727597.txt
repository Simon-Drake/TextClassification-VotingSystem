Increased chromosome abnormalities in human preimplantation embryos after in-vitro fertilization in patients with recurrent miscarriage.
Recurrent miscarriage is a pathological condition induced by maternal and embryonic causes. This paper describes a prospective study to determine the real incidence of aneuploidy for autosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, and gonosomes in preimplantation human embryos obtained from patients with recurrent pregnancy loss after ovarian stimulation in an IVF-ET programme. Our results indicate that aneuploidy for the chromosomes analysed are abnormally higher in embryos obtained after IVF from recurrent abortion patients (58%) compared to non-recurrent abortion patients undergoing IVF. Furthermore, monosomies are six times more frequent than trisomies (47:8) in preimplantation embryos from recurrent abortion patients. Based on the present study, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos obtained from patients with recurrent miscarriage could prove advantageous in diagnosing abnormal embryos and selecting normal embryos for transfer.
