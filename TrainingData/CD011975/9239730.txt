Direct assessment of triploid cells in mosaic human fetuses by fluorescence in-situ hybridization.
Villous tissues from 30 spontaneous abortions and the same number of artificial abortions were obtained and analysed for the frequency of polyploid cells. Single cell suspensions were made from these tissues without culture and the ploidy of > 100 cells was analysed. Trisomies of chromosomes 17 and 4 have rarely been reported in villous cells of spontaneous abortions, suggesting that the presence of more than three copies of chromosomes 17 and 4 per cell indicates polyploidy. The number of chromosomes 17 and 4 was detected by fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis using centromeric probes D17Z1 and D4Z1. Most villous cells from cases of spontaneous and artificial abortions had two D17Z1 or D4Z1 signals per cell, with very small percentages of cells (0.5 +/- 0.4%) showing three signals per cell. However, in four cases of spontaneous abortions, 2-12% of cells had three D17Z1 or D4Z1 signals per cell. This indicates the presence of triploid cells in these cases of spontaneous abortion, at a significantly higher frequency compared to artificial or the remaining 26 cases of spontaneous abortion. In addition, three cases contained 0.2-0.4% of cells showing six signals, indicating that these cells were dividing triploid cells. The low frequency of mosaicism reported here would not be detectable by conventional chromosomal analysis.
