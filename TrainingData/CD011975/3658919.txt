Chromosomal mosaicism confined to chorionic tissue.
Chorionic villus samples from two healthy pregnant females were obtained for first trimester fetal diagnosis. The karyotypes were 46,XX/47,XX,+3 and 46,XX/47,XX,+15, respectively. In both cases fibroblast cultures after termination of pregnancy were shown to have normal karyotypes.
