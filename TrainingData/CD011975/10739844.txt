Rapid determination of zygosity and common aneuploidies from amniotic fluid cells using quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction following genetic amniocentesis in multiple pregnancies.
Following second-trimester twin amniocentesis, we used quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) assays and polymorphic small tandem repeats (STR) for rapid determination of zygosity and common aneuploidies from amniotic fluid (AF) cells in four pregnancies with like-sex twins, fused placentae and inconclusive chorionicity. The first and the second cases were suspected to have inadvertent sampling of the same amniotic cavity twice. The first case showed a dizygotic (DZ) pattern and repeat amniocentesis was thus avoided. The second case was monozygotic (MZ) and was complicated by discordant fetal growth and twin-twin transfusion syndrome. The third case was associated with a co-twin malformation, occipital encephalocele. DNA studies revealed MZ twinning with a discordant structural defect. The fourth case was associated with co-twin abnormalities of cystic hygroma and hydrops fetalis. DNA studies showed DZ twinning with discordant structural and chromosomal defects. The QF-PCR assay with STR has the advantages of rapid determination of zygosity and common aneuploidies in AF cells. This simple test appears to be useful in the instances of possible inadvertent puncture of the same amniotic cavity twice during amniocentesis and of discordant fetal structural and/or chromosomal abnormalities following genetic amniocentesis in multiple pregnancies with uncertain chorionicity.
