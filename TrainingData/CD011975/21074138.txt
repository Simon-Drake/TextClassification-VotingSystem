Cost-effectiveness and accuracy of prenatal Down syndrome screening strategies: should the combined test continue to be widely used?
OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the cost-effectiveness (CE) and performances of commonly used prenatal Down syndrome (DS) screening strategies. STUDY DESIGN: We performed computer simulations to compare 8 screening options by applying empirical data from Serum, Urine, and Ultrasound Screening Study trials on the population of 110,948 pregnancies. Screening strategies outcomes, CE ratios, and incremental CE ratios were measured. RESULTS: The most CE DS screening strategy was the contingent screening method (CE ratio of Can$26,833 per DS case). Its incremental CE ratio compared to the second-most CE strategy (serum integrated screening) was Can$3815 per DS birth detected. Among the procedures respecting guidelines, our results identified the combined test as the screening strategy with the highest CE ratio (Can$47,358) and the highest number of procedure-related euploid miscarriages (n = 71). CONCLUSION: In regard to CE, contingent screening is the best choice. The combined test, which is the most popular screening strategy, shows many limitations.
