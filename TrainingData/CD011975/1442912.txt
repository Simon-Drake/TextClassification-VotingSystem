Screening for Down syndrome with the femur length/biparietal diameter ratio: a new twist of the data.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the value of discordant morphometric measurements as identifiers of Down syndrome by evaluating the relationship of biparietal diameter, femur length, biparietal diameter/femur length ratio, and cephalic index between a group of fetuses with trisomy 21 and a control population. STUDY DESIGN: Biometric measurements from 48 fetuses with trisomy were reviewed and compared with 107 normal fetuses of similar gestational age. Data were analyzed in 2-week gestational age intervals to determine the effect of gestational age on ultrasonographic detection of Down syndrome. Outcome measures were subject to least-squares linear regression and the t test for analysis. RESULTS: A positive relationship between abnormal morphometric measurements and fetuses with Down syndrome was detected but only during specific weeks of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Although it appears that biometric measurements may be useful for Down syndrome, further study is needed before its widespread introduction into clinical practice.
