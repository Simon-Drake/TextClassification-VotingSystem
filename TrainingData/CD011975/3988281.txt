On the significance of true trisomy 20 mosaicism in amniotic fluid culture.
Nine new cases of prenatally detected true mosaic trisomy 20 (T20) are reported. In three instances the fetuses were aborted. One fetus showed multiple malformations associated with a high percentage of T20 cells among amniotic fluid (AF) cells and fibroblasts of different fetal tissues. In two other fetuses only a slight facial dysmorphy was seen which was accompanied by a low percentage of T20 cells among AF cells. In five instances the pregnancies were carried to term, and normal somatic and psychomotor development of the children has been observed, in one case up to the age of 24 months. In one case the pregnancy is continuing. The T20 cells were not detected among cultured lymphocytes of these children. A review of the hitherto known cases of prenatally detected mosaic T20 indicates a relationship between the prenatal findings and the fetal development. This may serve as a provisory basis for genetic counselling: in the case of a percentage above 50% of T20 cells among AF cells there seems to be a risk of about 50% for the fetus to be affected by severe anomalies. However, in cases of a prenatally detected mosaic T20 with a percentage equal to or less than 50, fetal or congenital malformations have not been observed among 23 individuals so far examined.
