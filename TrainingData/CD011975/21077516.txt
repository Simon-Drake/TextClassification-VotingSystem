Recurrent aneuploidy--fact or fiction.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the likelihood that some women are more prone to forming chromosomally abnormal embryos unrelated to age. METHODS: The literature involving studies suggesting that predisposition to aneuploidy does exist was reviewed. In addition a new anecdotal unpublished report on a tendency to form trisomies is presented and a couple of case reports dealing with the possibility of predisposition to polyploidy are discussed. RESULTS: The results of in vitro fertilization and pre-implantation diagnoses confirm the suspicion that some women are more prone to trisomies or polyploidy. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro fertilization with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis may help in preventing miscarriage from recurrent polyploidy but is not so valuable for recurrent trisomies.
