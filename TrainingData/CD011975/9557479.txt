[Changes in fetal karyotype in non-immune hydrops fetalis].
BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Among the pregnant patients who underwent an amniocentesis at our department of prenatal diagnosis (Division of Gynecology and Obstetrics of the University "Federico II" in Naples) from 1989 to 1996, 16 patients were affected by non-immune hydrops faetalis associated with chromosomal diseases. RESULTS: The karyotype test revealed at an ultrasound exam of the fetus that 11 cases were affected by trisomy 21, 4 cases by Turner syndrome and one case by trisomy 18. This study took into consideration all the pathogenetic factors and the diagnostic problems of non-immune hydrops faetalis in fetus affected by associated chromosomal associated anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: Since the incidence of the chromosomal anomalies on fetus affected by non-immune hydrops foetal is was very high, there was the necessity to carry out a routine karyotype test if the ultrasonography revealed anomalies of the hydrops, during the first three months of pregnancy.
