Increased level of second trimester maternal serum chorionic gonadotropin in pregnancy with a fetus affected by homozygous alpha-thalassemia 1.
With enzyme immunoassay, maternal serum chorionic gonadotropin (MShCG) level was determined in 58 pregnancies affected with fetal homozygous alpha-thalassemia 1. In 40 pregnancies with a gestational age of 10 to 14 weeks, 8 (20%) had an MShCG level above 2.5 multiples of the median (MoM); while in the other 18 pregnancies with a gestational age of 15 to 23 weeks, 14 (78%) had a level above 2.5 MoMs and none had a level below the median. Homozygous alpha-thalassemia 1 of the fetus was associated with an elevated MShCG. Therefore in second-trimester screening for Down's syndrome by measurement of MShCG, homozygous alpha-thalassemia 1 should also be considered if elevated MShCG levels are found.
