Tissue-limited mosaicism for monosomy 13.
Karyotypic discordance between different tissues in an individual is uncommon. We report on a patient with multiple congenital anomalies and mosaicism for monosomy 13 limited to fibroblasts. Findings include microcephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, bilateral posterior colobomas, cataract and optic nerve dysplasia, patent foramen ovale, renal hypoplasia, hypospadias and unilateral inguinal hernia, unilateral hypoplasia of the lower limb, sparse and patchy hair, subtle pigmentary mosaicism, and global developmental delay. The lymphocyte karyotype was normal, whereas the fibroblast karyotype showed mosaicism for a del(13)(q11-->ter). Review of the literature identified three previous reports of similar patients with multiple congenital anomalies, normal lymphocyte karyotype, and subsequent, diagnostic fibroblast karyotyping. Comparison of the previously reported patients with the patient reported here defines a common phenotype for tissue-limited mosaicism for monosomy 13 consisting of prenatal-onset growth deficiency; microcephaly; facial abnormalities including prominent nasal bridge, hypertelorism, ptosis, epicanthal folds, microphthalmia, coloboma, retinoblastoma, prominent maxilla, micrognathia, and low-set ears; limb abnormalities including small to absent thumbs, clinodactyly of fifth finger, fused metacarpal bones 4 and 5, talipes equinovarus, and short first toe; cardiac defect; renal anomalies; and genitalia abnormalities including hypospadias and cryptorchidism. In conclusion, this case further emphasizes that fibroblast karyotyping should be employed when the diagnosis remains unclear, especially in the presence of pigmentary mosaicism or segmental hypoplasia.
