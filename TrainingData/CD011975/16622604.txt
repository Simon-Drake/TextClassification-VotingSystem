Mass-spectrometrical analysis of proteins encoded on chromosome 21 in human fetal brain.
Overexpression of chromosome 21 genes is directly or indirectly responsible for the Down syndrome phenotype. In order to analyse chromosome 21 gene products (Chr21Ps), we extracted proteins from fetal human brain cortex and applied an ultracentrifugal and chromatographic prefractionation principle followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass-spectrometrical analysis using high-throughput automated MALDI-TOF/TOF. Nine Chr21Ps were identified: pyridoxal kinase; superoxide dismutase [Cu/Zn] 1; carbonyl reductase 1; ES1 protein homolog, mitochondrial [Precursor]; cystathionine-beta-synthetase; T-complex protein 1, theta subunit; cystatin B; 6-phosphofructokinase; glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase. Mass-spectrometric characterisation of Chr21Ps following separation in 2-DE gels is a useful tool for the analysis of these structures in brain, independent of antibody availability and specificity.
