UNLABELLED: Evaluation of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and free beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta hCG) levels and sonographic assessment of fetal nuchal translucency (NT) in singleton pregnancies between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation--Poland's multi-centers research. OBJECTIVES: Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A has been reported to be low in Down syndrome affected pregnancies during the first trimester of pregnancy. Enlarged nuchal translucency (NT) is observed in about 80% of fetuses affected with chromosomal abnormalities and congenital heart defects (CHD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The aim of this study were to determine value and the medians of free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester in a prospective study of a non-selected Polish population. RESULTS: All examinations have been performed according to the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) rules. We have included 800 women between 11 weeks 0 days and 13 weeks 6 days gestation into a biochemical examination. Women booked into the clinic were offered screening, using a combination of maternal serum free beta-hCG and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and fetal nuchal translucency thickness. The maternal serum were measured using the Kryptor analyzer (Brahms Diagnostica). All pregnant women have been divided into 2 groups younger than (first group) and older than (second group) 35 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Nomogrames for free beta-hCG and PAPP-A levels in physiological pregnancy between 11(+0) and 13(6) weeks were determined in the examined population. A positive correlation between PAPP-A and CRL levels, as well as a weak negative correlation between free beta-hCG and CRL, were demonstrated.
