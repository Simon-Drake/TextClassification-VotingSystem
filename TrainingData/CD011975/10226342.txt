[Echogenic intracardiac structures (golf ball phenomenon) as predictors of chromosome anomalies].
UNLABELLED: Small echogenic areas in the fetal heart are known as the golf ball phenomenon. These structures are considered by some to be a marker for chromosomal anomalies. AIM: To prospectively study the relationship of echogenic intracardiac structures and chromosomal aberrations. METHODS: Over a 15 month period (6/96-9/97) 4500 unselected fetuses between 16-31 weeks were screened for malformations; in each case echogenic intracardiac structures were sought. RESULTS: In 77 cases (1.17%) single or multiple echogenic punctate intracardiac structures could be diagnosed. In 60 fetuses (78%) chromosome analysis was performed. Two (3.3%) had chromosomal abnormalities--trisomy 21 and 45.XO/46.XX. CONCLUSION: The golf ball phenomenon appears to be a normal variation in the development of the papillary muscle. This sign is usually easily to identify and if present, should lead to a more detailed screening for anomalies. In the case of other sonographic abnormalities, with advanced maternal age or with a positive triple test, a chromosomal analysis should be performed.
