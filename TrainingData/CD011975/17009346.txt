First-trimester maternal dried blood Down syndrome screening marker levels in early pregnancy loss.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of free beta hCG and PAPP-A measured during first-trimester Down syndrome risk assessment with early pregnancy loss when blood is drawn prior to scheduled ultrasound. METHODS: Maternal dried blood samples were collected prior to the ultrasound exam for Down syndrome risk assessment. Free beta hCG and PAPP-A levels in 55 patients who experienced loss of pregnancy prior to their scheduled ultrasound appointment were compared to 6464 control pregnancies using logistic regression. RESULTS: Low levels of free beta hCG and PAPP-A were associated with increased risk of early pregnancy loss. The detection rate of early pregnancy loss for a fixed 5% false-positive rate using free beta alone, PAPP-A alone and a combination of the two were 47, 36 and 49%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Free beta hCG and PAPP-A can identify pregnancies at increased risk for early pregnancy loss. More studies are needed to determine whether further evaluation of these pregnancies prior to the scheduled ultrasound is warranted.
