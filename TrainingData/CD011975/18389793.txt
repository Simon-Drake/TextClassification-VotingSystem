[FISH technique in aneuplodies prenatal diagnosis].
UNLABELLED: Chromosomal disorders are severe and affect 0.9% of the newborns. In these conditions, prenatal diagnosis should be compulsory in every public medical system. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Our study is a retrospective analysis of pregnant women investigated by amniocentesis and FISH technique. RESULTS: We analyzed 233 samples collected between 2004 and 2007 at Iasi "Cuza-Voda" Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. The majority of cases were investigated between 16 and 24 weeks of pregnancy. Thirty-eight abnormal cases (16.30%) were identified: 17 cases with 21 trisomy, 16 cases with 18 trisomy, 3 cases with X monosomy, and 2 cases with 13 trisomy. The main reasons for amniocentesis were: advanced maternal age (12.5% abnormal cases) ultrasound abnormalities (26.15% abnormal cases), and biochemical abnormalities (7.14% abnormal cases). CONCLUSION: Our data are in agreement with other studies, and support our results.
