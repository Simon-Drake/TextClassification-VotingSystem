Judgment, 28 July 1988.
The High Regional Court at Dusseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany, held that a physician is required to provide advice to a patient about age-related risks in pregnancy, including advice on possible birth defects and tests that can help the patient decide whether to continue the pregnancy. The physician also must not oversimplify explanations of risks or overemphasize the dangers involved in amniocentesis. The Court ruled that a physician was negligent in giving advice when he, in fact, dissuaded a patient over the age of 40 from undergoing amniocentesis, with the result that she gave birth to a child suffering from Down's syndrome. It ordered him to pay support for the child.
