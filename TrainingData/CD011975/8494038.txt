Method for sequential staining of GTL-banded metaphases with fluorescent-labeled chromosome-specific paint probes.
We describe a method for use of fluorescent-labeled whole chromosome-specific paint probes on GTL-banded metaphases to utilize the combined potential of these techniques for defining chromosome abnormalities. The efficacy of this method was tested on 6 cases involving different chromosome abnormalities and various tissues, including blood, amniotic fluid, skin fibroblasts, and bone marrow.
