Two cases of tetrasomy 9p syndrome with tissue limited mosaicism.
Tetrasomy of short arm of chromosome 9 constitutes a clinically recognizable chromosomal syndrome. Isochromosome 9p shows a strong propensity to tissue-limited mosaicism. It occurs predominantly in peripheral blood cultures, often at a lower frequency or even absent in skin, amniotic fluid or chorionic villous cell cultures. Tissue-limited nature of mosaicism may render prenatal detection of this condition very difficult. Herein, we report two new cases of mosaic tetrasomy 9p. Conventional cytogenetics (CC) and FISH studies demonstrated a differential expression of the mosaicism in several tissues. We review the literature and discuss the implications of these findings in cytogenetic prenatal diagnosis.
