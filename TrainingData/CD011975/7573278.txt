Significance of prenatal diagnosis of umbilical cord cyst in a fetus with trisomy 18.
An umbilical cord cyst was detected in a fetus who underwent ultrasonography at 38 weeks' gestation for clinical suspicion of intrauterine growth retardation. Such an association should alert the clinician to the possibility of aneuploidy, thus guiding clinical management. This case represents the second report of a cystic umbilical lesion in a fetus with trisomy 18.
