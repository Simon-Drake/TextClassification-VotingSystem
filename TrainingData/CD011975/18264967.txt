ADAM12s in maternal serum as a potential marker of pre-eclampsia.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether maternal serum ADAM12s, a potential first- and second-trimester marker of fetal aneuploidy and fetal growth, had altered concentrations in the first or second trimester of pregnancies subsequently developing pre-eclampsia. METHODS: ADAM12s was measured by a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay developed by PerkinElmer Life Science. Maternal serum samples from women taking part in early first-trimester aneuploidy screening in whom the pregnancy resulted in pre-eclampsia (64) were identified from a cohort of 4,390 singleton pregnancies in which uterine artery Doppler mean Pulsatility Index (PI) had been measured at 22-24 weeks. From amongst those cases delivering a normal term infant with birth weight greater than the 10th centile for gestational age 240 cases were selected as gestational age-matched controls. A second study group consisting of maternal serum taken at 22-24 weeks at the time of uterine artery Doppler in a group of 12 women developing pre-eclampsia were compared with 86 matched controls from a previously studied cohort of 24 cases and 144 controls. Serum ADAM12s concentrations were converted to multiple of the median (MoM) to take account of gestational age variation. RESULTS: First-trimester maternal serum ADAM12s levels in women who developed pre-eclampsia were reduced with a median MoM of 0.71 which was further reduced in those delivering prior to 35 weeks (0.50). At the 5th centile of normal (0.48 MoM) ADAM12s identified 27% of cases with pre-eclampsia and 47% of those with early pre-eclampsia. Combining ADAM12s with PAPP-A from a previous study only resulted in a further 1% increase in detection of all women developing pre-eclampsia. However combining ADAM12s with mean PI increased the detection rate to 66%. In the second trimester at 22-24 weeks the maternal serum ADAM12s levels were increased in those women developing pre-eclampsia compared to controls (709 vs 486 ug/L, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: ADAM12s in addition to being a potential marker of aneuploidy may also be a marker of pre-eclampsia. Further studies are required to see if this can improve on the clinical discrimination already provided by PAPP-A in the early first trimester.
