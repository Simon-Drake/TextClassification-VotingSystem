A rare case of 68,XX triploidy diagnosed by amniocentesis.
68,XX triploidy was found in the amniotic fluid cell culture of a 40-year-old patient. Elective termination of the pregnancy revealed a fetus with multiple congenital anomalies. While this case does show some common features with monosomy X, a greater similarity to the triploidy syndrome is observed.
