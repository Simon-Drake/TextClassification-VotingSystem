Clinical outcome and follow-up of the first reported case of Russell-Silver syndrome with the unique combination of maternal uniparental heterodisomy 7 and mosaic trisomy 7.
BACKGROUND: Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS) has been associated with maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) for chromosome 7 although the etiology of the syndrome is still unknown. Cases of RSS associated with maternal UPD7 have involved isodisomies, heterodisomies, and mixed isodisomy with heterodisomy simultaneously. This publication is a follow-up report of the postnatal clinical outcome of the first prenatally suspected case of combined mosaic trisomy 7 with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD7). CASE: The diagnosis of RSS in the proband was suspected prenatally because trisomy 7 mosaicism (47,XX,+7[13]/46,XX[19]) and maternal uniparental heterodisomy 7 were both found in amniotic fluid cells. Cord blood karyotype analysis showed only disomic cells (46,XX[50]), whereas postpartum chorionic villus analysis was completely trisomic for chromosome 7 (47,XX,+7[19]). Postnatally, the diagnosis of RSS was confirmed by physical findings, her trisomy 7 mosaicism was confirmed by cytogenetic analysis of her skin biopsy (47,XX,+7[9]/46,XX[20]) and her UPD7 was confirmed on both peripheral blood and skin biopsy using microsatellite markers. During infancy, the proband experienced growth deficiency, persistent hypoglycemia, and psychomotor developmental delay. CONCLUSIONS: Trisomic rescue as a life-saving mechanism, with subsequent chromosomal mosaicism in combination with UPD may occur more frequently in RSS than has been reported. Systematic testing of cases suspected prenatally or postnatally would be informative regarding the individual contribution of each factor. Imprinting, loss of heterozygosity for recessive genes, and mosaicism may explain the short stature, asymmetry, and the variable expression of the phenotype. The contribution of these mechanisms to the syndrome should be evaluated in these cases.
