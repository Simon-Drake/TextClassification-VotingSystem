Prenatal diagnosis of mosaicism for a del(22)(q13).
A case of prenatally detected mosaicism for a del(22)(q13) is reported. CVS was performed because of abnormal fetal ultrasound findings: cystic 'tumour' in the fetal neck and the upper thoracic aperture. Karyotypes from chorionic villi were suspicious of an aberration concerning the long arm of one chromosome 22. FISH analysis demonstrated mosaicism for a distal 22q deletion in fetal fibroblasts. The deletion was postnatally confirmed by FISH with a chromosome-specific 22q probe. The 'tumour' on autopsy turned out to be cystic thymic tissue. Apart from this, no other obvious fetal anomalies were found.
