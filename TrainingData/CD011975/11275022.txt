Serum homocysteine at 16 weeks and subsequent preeclampsia.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether elevated homocysteine levels precede the development of preeclampsia. METHODS: Study subjects were selected from a population-based cohort of 1049 nulliparous women from whom serum was collected for Down syndrome screening at 16 weeks' gestation. For 34 women who developed preeclampsia, 68 control women were chosen who remained normotensive. Homocysteine was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection. The sample size allowed detection of a 1.25-micromol/L difference at a significance level of 0.05 and the power of 0.81. RESULTS: At 16 weeks' gestation, concentrations (mean, 95% confidence interval) of homocysteine in women who developed preeclampsia, 6.99 (6.42, 7.55) micromol/L, were similar to those who remained normotensive, 6.91 (6.45, 7.34) micromol/L. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in homocysteine metabolism did not predate the appearance of clinical preeclampsia.
