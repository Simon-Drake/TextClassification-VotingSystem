Live delivery following transfer of a single frozen-thawed embryo derived from a 42-year-old woman with marked decreased oocyte reserve.
PURPOSE: To determine if live birth is possible in a woman of older reproductive age and who has markedly decreased oocyte reserve following frozen embryo transfer of an oocyte fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection of testicular sperm. METHODS: Ethinyl estradiol followed by ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins was used and a mature follicle was attained. Following oocyte retrieval 34 hours later, intracytoplasmic sperm injection of testicular sperm was performed. The embryo was cryopreserved. RESULTS: A live delivery of a full-term baby ensued. Following subsequent frozen embryo transfer, the baby was diagnosed with Down's syndrome and subsequently died. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a live delivery following frozen embryo transfer in a woman of advanced reproductive age with marked decreased oocyte reserve.
