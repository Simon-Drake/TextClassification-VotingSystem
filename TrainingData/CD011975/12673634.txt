False-positive diagnosis of trisomy 21 using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) on uncultured amniotic fluid cells.
An amniocentesis was performed on a 22-week pregnancy following the detection of foetal abnormalities on ultrasound. A rapid aneuploid screen using fluorescence in situ hybridisation on uncultured amniotic fluid cells revealed 3 signals for chromosome 21, consistent with trisomy 21. In situ metaphase cultures revealed a 46,XY normal male karyotype. These discordant results may be explained by a sub-standard batch of the commercially available probe or alternatively, a very specific variation within the sample interacting with the probe. Alternative strategies are proposed in order to safeguard against inappropriate clinical action as a consequence of discordant results.
