Aneuploidies in embryos and spermatozoa from patients with Y chromosome microdeletions.
In patients with Y chromosome microdeletions and high percentage of numeric chromosome abnormalities detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization on sperm, a high percentage of abnormal embryos was observed compared with oligozoospermic patients without Y chromosome microdeletions, with a significant increase in the percentage of embryos with monosomy X. Differences in fertilization rates between the different patient groups were not observed; however, blastocyst rates were significantly impaired in patients with Y chromosome microdeletions.
