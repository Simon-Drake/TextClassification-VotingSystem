Factors influencing parental decision making in prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidy.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate factors influencing parental decisions toward continuing or terminating a pregnancy with prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidy. METHODS: We reviewed the records of patients with fetuses with sex chromosome aneuploidy between 1990 and 2001. A questionnaire survey of women who chose to terminate such pregnancies was designed to examine aspects of their decision-making process. RESULTS: Forty-nine of 89 pregnancies with sex chromosome aneuploidy were terminated (termination rate 0.55; 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.65). Pregnancies with abnormal ultrasound findings (14/16, 87%), with 45,X or 47,XXY karyotypes (26/36, 72%), and with nonmosaic karyotypes (30/48, 63%) were terminated significantly more often than pregnancies with normal ultrasound findings (35/73, 48%; P <.01), with 47,XXX or 47,XYY karyotypes (4/12, 33%; P <.05), and with mosaic karyotypes (5/25, 20%; P =.01). There was a trend (P =.136) toward a lower rate of termination from 67% to 36% across time, with a significant decrease from 67% to 7% in pregnancies with 47,XXX; 47,XYY; and mosaic karyotypes (P <.01), and no change in cases with 45,X and 47,XXY karyotypes (67% compared with 69%; P = 1.0). Abnormal sexual development and infertility were the greatest parental concerns related to termination. CONCLUSION: Fear of having a child with abnormal sexual development or infertility remains the major determinant of parental decision toward terminating pregnancy, resulting in consistently high termination rates across time in pregnancies with 45,X and 47,XXY karyotypes. In cases with 47,XXX; 47,XYY; and mosaic karyotypes, the declining termination rate across time is a consequence of recent studies reporting normal sexual development and fertility.
