Molecular cytogenetic analysis of term placentae suspected of mosaicism using fluorescence in situ hybridization.
In first-trimester chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for prenatal diagnosis, abnormal chromosomal findings, such as mosaicism, trisomies, or suspect abnormal karyotypes, are found more frequently than at amniocentesis. The fact that these chromosomal abnormalities do not always reflect the fetal karyotype but may be restricted to the placenta is a major problem in diagnosis and counselling. In this paper we present the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on interphase nuclei of three term placentae investigated because of false-positive findings at first-trimester CVS. The chorionic villi of the first case showed a mosaic chromosome pattern involving a trisomy 10 cell line and a normal cell line, those of the second case a total trisomy 8 cell line, while in the third case a complete monosomy X was found. Follow-up amniocentesis in each of these three cases revealed a normal karyotype. By using FISH, we were able to confirm the presence of the aberrant cell lines, which were all confined to one part of the placenta. FISH on interphase nuclei allows the investigation of large numbers of cells for the existence of numerical chromosome aberrations in a quick and reliable way.
