Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-E (PAPP-E).
A full-length cDNA encoding a novel human protein was cloned from placenta cDNA. The corresponding 1542 amino acid protein sequence was termed 'pregnancy-associated plasma protein-E' (PAPP-E) as it shows a 62% homology to the human pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) that is a diagnostic marker for trisomies, especially Down syndrome. The conserved domain structure contains five motifs related to the short consensus repeats of complement proteins and selectins, three motifs related to the lin-notch motifs of proteins regulating early tissue differentiation, and a putative zinc-binding motif and active site of the metzincin-superfamily of metalloproteases. The PAPP-E gene was localized to chromosome 1q23-25. Northern blot analysis showed that PAPP-E is predominantly expressed in placenta.
