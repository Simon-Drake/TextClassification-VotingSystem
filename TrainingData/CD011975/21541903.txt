[Obstetric management of fetal growth retardation].
Intrauterine growth restriction (IGUR) can have different etiologies, but placental insufficiency is the clinically most relevant. Fetuses with IUGR have a significantly higher morbidity and mortality than normally grown fetuses of the same gestational age. It is important to distinguish a growth restricted fetus from a normal, small fetus and from a fetus being small because of a disease, e.g., an aneuploidy. This differentiation requires the knowledge of the gestational age and the use of multiple imaging modalities. Serial assessments of fetal growth by ultrasound are necessary to recognize declining growth. Doppler sonography can detect changes in the uteroplacentar and the fetal perfusion. Blood vessels of clinical relevance are the uterine arteries, the umbilical artery, the middle cerebral artery and the ductus venosus. When no fetal anomalies can be detected, fetal growth is parallel to the percentiles and Doppler sonography measurements are normal, IUGR is unlikely. In most IUGR fetuses, a typical sequence of circulatory changes and ultrasound findings can be observed. As there is no evidence-based treatment option for IUGR until now, obstetric management consists in defining the optimal time of delivery. This means weighing the risks of prematurity against the risks of a potentially hostile intrauterine environment.
