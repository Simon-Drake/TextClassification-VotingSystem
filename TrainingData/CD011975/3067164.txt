Prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling.
The future of chorionic villus sampling can only be envisioned in the light of current knowledge. Amniocentesis will undoubtedly continue to hold an important place in prenatal diagnosis and has recently assumed greater importance in diagnosing neural tube defects and Down syndrome through widespread maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening. Patients now have a choice in prenatal diagnostic procedures for most genetic disorders. Many are already choosing chorionic villus sampling despite the questions that remain regarding risks and diagnostic accuracy. Risk figures for miscarriages due to the procedure and for intrauterine infection are especially needed. The issues of maternal contamination in laboratory analyses and chromosomal mosaicism that may not be present in the fetus are also of prime importance. Collaborative efforts continue to answer these and other questions so that in the future patients will be better able to make informed decisions regarding prenatal diagnosis.
