Prenatal diagnosis and clinical features of an individual with tetrasomy 18p and trisomy 18q mosaicism.
Prenatal diagnosis and clinical follow up of a patient with mosaicism for anomalies of chromosome 18 are reported. The fetus appeared on ultrasound to have multiple anomalies, including clubbed feet, abnormal hand positioning, edema of the scalp, cleft palate, and polyhydramnios. The karyotype on amniocytes was 47,XY,+i(18p). Postnatally, the peripheral blood karyotype was 46,XY,+i(18q), whereas the skin fibroblast karyotype was 47,XY,+i(18p). The infant had many features consistent with those previously described in cases of tetrasomy 18p and some that were consistent with trisomy 18q.
