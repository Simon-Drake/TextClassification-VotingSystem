Ullrich-Turner syndrome in an XY female fetus with deletion of the sex-determining portion of the Y chromosome.
Here we describe a fetus in whom a cystic hygroma was detected by ultrasound during the second trimester. Autopsy demonstrated a female fetus with manifestations of Ullrich-Turner syndrome, including gonadal dysgenesis, generalized lymphedema, and preductal aortic coarctation. Surprisingly, the karyotype was 46,XY, with no evidence of mosaicism for a 45,X cell line. Y-DNA hybridization studies demonstrated a deletion of the sex-determining segment of the short arm of the Y chromosome. This is the first report, in a fetus, of XY Ullrich-Turner syndrome due to a Y chromosome deletion.
