Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein levels in the differential diagnosis of cystic hygroma.
In 7 second trimester pregnancies ultrasound (US) demonstrated cystic hygroma colli (CHC); amniocentesis was performed in 6 patients. In the 7th patient, because of oligohydramnios, the fluid for karyotype was aspirated from the CHC. Five pregnancies had been referred secondary to abnormalities on US and 2 others because of low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). Four karyotypes were abnormal (45,X;47,XX+21; 47,XY+21; 46,XX/45,X), and 3 had normal karyotypes. Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFAFP) was normal in 4 pregnancies and low in 2 (0.09 MOM, 0.41 MOM). Of 2 pregnancies with trisomy 21 one had been referred for low MSAFP. In 2 pregnancies with normal karyotypes, US findings at early gestational age (14-17 weeks) of small, nonseptated, bilateral CHC disappeared during pregnancy; these women delivered normal, term babies. Most prenatally diagnosed CHC are not in fetuses with Turner syndrome. With a normal karyotype and CHC as the only finding on early US in utero, normal neonatal survival is possible. AFAFP is not elevated in pregnancies with CHC. If AFAFP is elevated with a positive acetylcholinesterase, such results may suggest that the CHC was inadvertently aspirated.
