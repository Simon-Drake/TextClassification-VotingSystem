Oocyte donation to women of advanced reproductive age: pregnancy results and obstetrical outcomes in patients 45 years and older.
We analysed the results of oocyte donation to women of advanced reproductive age (> or = 45 years old) and followed their pregnancies through to delivery in order to assess obstetrical outcomes. Patients (n = 162) aged 45-59 years (mean +/- SD; 47.3 +/- 3.4 years) underwent 218 consecutive attempts to achieve pregnancy. Oocytes (16.2 +/- 7.2 per retrieval) were provided by donors < or = 35 years old. Cleaving embryos (8.2 +/- 4.8 zygotes/couple) were transferred transcervically (4.5 +/- 1.1 per embryo transfer) to recipients prescribed oral micronized oestradiol and intramuscular progesterone. Following oocyte aspiration there were six instances of non-fertilization (2.8%) and 212 embryo transfers. A total of 103 pregnancies was established for an overall pregnancy rate (PR) of 48.6%, which included 17 preclinical pregnancies, 12 spontaneous abortions, and 74 delivered pregnancies (clinical PR 40.6%; delivered PR 34.9%). Multiple gestations were frequent (n = 29; 39.2% of pregnancies) and included 20 twins, seven triplets, and two quadruplets. Two of the triplet and both of the quadruplet pregnancies underwent selective reduction to twins. Antenatal complications occurred in 28 women (37.8% of deliveries) and included preterm labour (n = 9), gestational hypertension (n = 8), gestational diabetes (n = 6), carpel tunnel syndrome (n = 2), pre-eclampsia (n = 2), HELLP syndrome (n = 2), and fetal growth retardation (n = 2). 48 (64.8%) deliveries were by Caesarean section. The gestational age at delivery for singletons was 38.3 +/- 1.3 weeks (range 35-41 weeks), with birth weight 3218 +/- 513 g (range 1870-4775 g); twins 35.9 +/- 2.0 weeks (range 32-39 weeks), birth weight 2558 +/- 497 g (range 1700-3450 g); and triplets 33.5 +/- 0.7 weeks (range 32-34 weeks), birth weight 1775 +/- 190 g (range 1550-2100 g). Neonatal complications (4.6% of babies born) included growth retardation (n = 2), trisomy 21 (n = 1), ventricular septal defect (n = 1), and small bowel obstruction (n = 1). There were no maternal or neonatal deaths. We conclude that oocyte donation to women of advanced reproductive age is highly successful in establishing pregnancy. However, despite careful antenatal screening, obstetrical complications are common, often secondary to multiple gestation.
