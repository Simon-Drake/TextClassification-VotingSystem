Human brain nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha subunit is decreased in patients with Alzheimer' s disease and Down syndrome.
Nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) protein, a heterodimeric complex of alpha- and beta-subunits, prevents mistargeting of nascent polypeptide chains to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. alpha-NAC has sequence similarities with transcription-regulating proteins and has been reported to function as a transcriptional coactivator potentiating c-Jun-mediated transcription. Performing gene hunting using differential display-polymerase chain reaction, a downregulated sequence in the frontal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS) with AD-like neuropathology was identified as a-NAC with 100% homology. The significant decrease in alpha-NAC mRNA was shown by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and in parallel, the significant decrease of alpha-NAC protein, which was even more pronounced when related to either actin or neuron-specific enolase levels, was also observed in both disorders. Linear regression analysis revealed a strong, significant correlation between alpha-NAC protein and mRNA expression. In fetal DS brain, however, mRNA levels of alpha-NAC were comparable between DS and controls, suggesting that the decrease in alpha-NAC might be involved in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. The decrease in alpha-NAC as a transcriptional coactivator could contribute to the characteristic decline of the c-Jun-mediated transcriptional machinery and could function as the complementary mechanism in c-Jun-mediated apoptosis. Decreased alpha-NAC may result in the mistargeting, mistranslation, and proteolysis of proteins by affecting overall NAC function.
