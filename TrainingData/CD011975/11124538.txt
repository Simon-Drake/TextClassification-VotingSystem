Gamete segregation in female carriers of Robertsonian translocations.
Eleven female carriers of either 45,XX,der(13;14) (q10;q10) or 45,XX, der(14;21)(q10;q10) underwent hormonal stimulation with the purpose of producing enough oocytes for in-vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Polar body biopsy was performed in those oocytes and FISH with painting probes was applied in their metaphase-like first polar body chromosomes. In this way, unbalanced, normal and balanced oocytes could be distinguished and segregation modes ascertained. der(14;21)(q10;q10) produced 42% unbalanced, 37% normal and 21% balanced oocytes (n = 86) while der(13;14)(q10;q10) generated 33% unbalanced, 51% normal and 16% balanced oocytes (n = 69). In both translocations the number of normal oocytes was significantly higher than the number of balanced oocytes. However, while the frequency of unbalanced events involving chromosome 13 and 14 was similar in der(13;14)(q10;q10), there were significantly more abnormalities involving chromosome 21 than 14 in the der(14;21) (q10;q10) cases. When comparing survival rates to term, trisomies from Robertsonian origin seem to survive more often than those originated by non-disjunction in non-translocation carriers. The meiotic segregation patterns found in female Robertsonian translocations are different from those described in male carriers, with higher rates of unbalanced gametes in females than in males.
