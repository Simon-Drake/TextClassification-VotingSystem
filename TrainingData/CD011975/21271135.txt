[Cytogenetic analysis of material from spontaneous abortion].
OBJECTIVE: To describe chromosomal abnormalities in spontaneous abortion material. METHODS: A retrospective compilation of karyotype analysis of slides stained with Band G was carried out by optical microscopy with materials of 428 abortion products referred for study. RESULTS: There were 145 normal results (33.9%) and 237 abnormal results (55.4%). In 46 samples there was no cell growth (10.7%). Numerical abnormalities were the most frequent, especially trisomy 16 (41 cases), triplodia (27 cases), monosomy X (26 cases), tetraploidy (13 cases) and trisomy 15 (13 cases). CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic alterations are an important cause of pregnancy loss and their detection helps the genetic counseling to the couple. Trisomy 16 is the most often found change.
