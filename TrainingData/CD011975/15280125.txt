The changing face of gastroschisis and omphalocele in southeast Georgia.
OBJECTIVE: To document trends in the clinical characteristics of gastroschisis and omphalocele in southeast Georgia, USA, from 1994 to 2002. METHODS: All babies with an abdominal wall defect in a 19-county region were referred to one Perinatal Center for genetic counseling, level II ultrasound scans, pregnancy follow-up and delivery. Karyotyping was offered for omphalocele, advanced maternal age, family history predisposing to aneuploidy, and gastroschisis with an additional anomaly. RESULTS: There were 64 patients, 34 with gastroschisis and 30 with omphalocele. From 1994 to 2002, the birth prevalence of gastroschisis was 1:3600 and omphalocele 1:3400, but from 2000 to 2002, gastroschisis increased to 1:1667, while omphalocele increased to only 1:2709. Gender distribution was different: for gastroschisis the M:F ratio was 1:2.1; for omphalocele the ratio was 1.7:1. In the patients with omphalocele, 90% had an amniocentesis and 9/27 were aneuploid: five had trisomy 18, three had trisomy 13 and one had trisomy 21. Seventy-six per cent of the patients with omphalocele had associated anomalies, but only 17.6% of those with gastroschisis. Mothers whose babies had gastroschisis showed a trend to progressively younger age, while no such trend was observed among mothers whose babies had omphalocele. CONCLUSION: The birth prevalence of abdominal wall defects in general is increasing, but more notably for gastroschisis. Maternal age continues to decrease for gastroschisis. In the study population, gender distribution showed a statistically significant variation between the defects.
