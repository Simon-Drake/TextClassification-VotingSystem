Clinical application of inhibin a measurement: prenatal serum screening for Down syndrome.
Inhibin A is secreted in significant quantities by the corpus luteum and fetoplacental unit, suggesting a role in fertility and pregnancy. Negative feedback regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone during pregnancy is one expected function of inhibin A, but the complete repertoire of actions of this hormone in pregnancy, including paracrine and autocrine actions, is yet to be fully understood. Inhibin A levels have been carefully described throughout normal pregnancy and studied in association with maternal and fetal complication such as intrauterine growth restriction, preterm labor or delivery, and preeclampsia. The first clinical application of inhibin A measurement in pregnancy has been its use as a second-trimester maternal serum marker for Down syndrome. Our laboratory was among the first, in 1998, to implement Quad marker screening, inhibin A measurement in conjunction with alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated estriol, and human chorionic gonadotropin, to assess patients' risk of having a Down syndrome baby. The test performance of the Quad test has been validated by several large studies, detecting about 80% of Down syndrome pregnancies at a 5% false-positive rate. The present review describes Down syndrome and the use of inhibin A in second-trimester prenatal screening. We also address the method used for inhibin A measurement, the biology of inhibin A in Down syndrome pregnancy, and the effects of covariates and other fetal abnormalities on inhibin A levels.
