Intracardiac echogenic focus and trisomy 21 in a population previously evaluated by first-trimester combined screening.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between intracardiac echogenic focus (ICEF) and trisomy 21 in a population of fetuses previously evaluated by first-trimester combined screening. DESIGN: Prospective study to evaluate the prevalence of trisomy 21 for four groups of pregnancies: those with isolated ICEF, those with ICEF and positive first-trimester combined screening, those with ICEF and other ultrasound markers, and those with ICEF, positive first-trimester combined screening and other ultrasound markers. SETTING: Teaching hospital. POPULATION: A total of 7,118 fetuses received first-trimester combined screening and a second-trimester fetal anatomical scan. METHODS: Amniocentesis for karyotyping was offered for those with positive result of first-trimester combined screening, and for those with the diagnosis of ICEF or other fetal chromosomal aneuploidy ultrasound markers in mid-trimester detailed fetal anatomical scans. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence of trisomy 21 in each group. RESULTS: For the entire study population, 25 trisomy 21 cases were diagnosed prenatally (prevalence, 0.35%). Among fetuses with positive first-trimester combined screening results, the likelihood ratio of trisomy 21 was significantly increased for those with, as compared to without, ICEF (3.5 vs. 0.80, p = 0.012). However, among fetuses with negative first-trimester combined screening results, the likelihood ratios of trisomy 21 did not differ significantly between those with and without ICEF. CONCLUSION: In pregnancies complicated by isolated ICEF but lacking additional anomalies on ultrasonographic examination and exhibiting negative first-trimester combined screening results, fetal karyotyping is not indicated.
