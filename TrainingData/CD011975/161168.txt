Genetic counselling for neurological disorders.
When parents have a child with any problem, they usually become concerned about the chances of this problem recurring if they have further children, or of appearing in their grandchildren. Similarly, persons with any congenital disorder themselves or family history of such disorder, often worry about their future children. Genetic counselling can in most cases provide reassurance that there is little need for concern. In those instances where the risks are real, they can be put into perspective and often effectively circumvented by procedures such as prenatal diagnosis. Pregnant women of advanced age run increased risks of having children with chromosome disorders; it is of benefit to individual couples and to the community to refer such women for amniocentesis.
