Prenatal diagnosis of de novo unbalanced translocation 8p;21q using subtelomeric probes.
We report an unbalanced translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 21 in a fetus showing ultrasonographic abnormalities in the second trimester of pregnancy. A 41-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 1 para 0, was referred to the Genetics Clinic at the 16th week of gestation because of advanced maternal age and fetal pelvicaliectasis on ultrasonographic examination. Pregnancy had occurred following ICSI treatment. After genetic counseling amniocentesis was performed. Fetal karyotype analysis revealed a 46,XY,8p+ karyotype. Ultrasonographic examination was repeated at the 20th week of gestation and showed intrauterine growth retardation, ventriculomegaly, cerebellar structural abnormality and pelvicaliectasis. Chromosomes of both parents were normal. Molecular cytogenetic studies (FISH) using chromosome-specific subtelomere probes showed a terminal deletion of 8p and trisomy of the 21q subtelomeric region. Further analysis with Down Syndrome specific region probes revealed two signals. The couple decided to terminate the pregnancy. This is the first prenatally diagnosed case of unbalanced t(8p;21q) of de novo origin.
