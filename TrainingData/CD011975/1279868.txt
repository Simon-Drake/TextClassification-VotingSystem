[Programs of mass and selective screening of pregnant women in prenatal studies. Screening of alpha fetoprotein in the blood serum of the mother].
The total of 38479 echography studies and 25147 alpha-fetoprotein estimations in mother blood serum have been performed upon prenatal screening. 445 congenital developmental defects are revealed. AFP base and limiting values (2.5 MoM and 0.5 MoM) are found. AFP values and echocardiography results in the nor and in genetic syndromes of multiple congenital developmental defects are compared. It is found that AFP values are higher than MoM or only slightly higher than Me in the same syndromes. The different level of AFP for the same syndromes appeared to be associated with the phenomenon of overlapping due to the clinical polymorphism and type of injury of the nervous system and with the extent of changes in placenta, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord were revealed in 99% of syndromes. The increased AFP level can be considered as a marker to detect signs of the genetic syndromes. Low AFP level peculiar to aneuploidy appeared to be normal or increased. The AFP test can be used as a marker of changed embryogenesis.
