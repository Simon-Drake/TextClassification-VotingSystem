First-trimester Down's syndrome screening by fetal nuchal translucency measurement in Taiwan.
BACKGROUND: Fetal nuchal translucency (NT) measurement is now widely used in many Western countries as a screening tool for Down's syndrome during the first trimester. However, at present there is no data on its use in Taiwan. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of NT measurement in first-trimester Down's syndrome screening in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study from October 1997 to May 1999. Sonographic measurement of fetal NT was performed in 1,249 fetuses at 9-14 weeks of gestation. Transabdominal ultrasound scanning was performed to obtain a sagittal section of the fetus for measuring the crown-rump length (CRL) and the maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucency between the skin and the soft tissue overlying the cervical spine. Two different cut-off points were used for screening: a fixed cut-off point of at least 2.5 mm and a CRL-related cut-off point. In the latter method, fetuses with an NT measurement in the 95th percentile were considered at high risk for Down's syndrome. RESULTS: Three fetuses had Down's syndrome, with NT measurements of 2.1 mm, 2.7 mm, and 4.0 mm. The false positive rates for the fixed cut-off point and CRL-related cut-off point were 6.3% and 4.6%, respectively. Both methods had a sensitivity of 66.7%. However, the screening program using the CRL-related cut-off point had two advantages: a higher specificity (95.5% vs 93.8%) and a more reasonable distribution pattern for screening. CONCLUSION: This study showed that NT measurement is a potential screening tool for Down's syndrome during the first trimester in Taiwan. Using CRL-related cut-off points for screening is more reasonable than using a fixed cut-off point.
