Prenatal diagnosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women: a new screening program for chromosomal anomalies.
OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to describe a new prenatal diagnosis program among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women, and the perinatal outcome of this program's application over a more than 2-year period. STUDY DESIGN: From June 2000 to December 2003, all HIV-infected women who were booked into the antenatal clinic before 20 weeks were offered a screening for chromosomal anomalies, with midtrimester amniocentesis in the tests that were positive. RESULTS: A total of 116 pregnancies (including 3 sets of twins) were seen: 96 women were offered and accepted screening for chromosomal anomalies. Thirteen pregnancies had a positive screening test and amniocentesis was performed in 10 at median 16.5 gestational weeks: a trisomy 21 and a monosomy X were diagnosed. No vertical transmissions were documented by age 6 months in the 6 liveborn infants who underwent amniocentesis. CONCLUSION: A program of prenatal diagnosis for chromosomal anomalies appears to be effective when applied to HIV-infected women, although safety remains to be proven.
