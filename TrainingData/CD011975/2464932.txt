The impact of MSAFP screening on genetic services, 1984-1986.
The impact of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening on genetic centers was investigated by a questionnaire mailed to 220 genetic centers in the United States. Eighty-four (38%) of centers responded to the questionnaire; of these (34%) were adequate for analysis. About 33% of the programs performed their own MSAFP testing. Approximately 70% of centers used 2.5 times the median (MoM) as a cutoff for MSAFP elevations and approximately 75% of centers used a sliding cutoff for low MSAFP based on both maternal age and the multiple of the median. Between 1984 and 1986, the total number of women screened by the reporting centers increased by about 4.7 fold. The percentage of women seen in their centers for prenatal counseling due to high or low MSAFP levels increased from 1.3% in 1984 to 13.1% in 1986. The percentage of prenatal diagnoses utilizing amniocentesis for high or low MSAFP increased from 3% in 1984 to 10% in 1986. During this period, 76 cases of Down syndrome were detected based on low MSAFP; this represents 1.7% of amniocenteses for low MSAFP. These data demonstrate a significant increase in the number of women seen for prenatal counseling and amniocentesis at the reporting genetic centers and is likely to represent a similar trend at all genetic centers. The impact of high MSAFP screening for neural tube defects and low MSAFP screening for Down syndrome is likely to increase over the coming years and genetic programs should prepare for the increasing utilization of services necessary to handle women with high and low MSAFP levels.
