Parental origin of the extra chromosome in prenatally diagnosed fetal trisomy 21.
Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is one of the most common chromosomal abnormalities. Of cases of free trisomy 21 causing Down syndrome, about 95% result from nondisjunction during meiosis, and about 5% are due to mitotic errors in somatic cells. Previous studies using DNA polymorphisms of chromosome 21 showed that paternal origin of trisomy 21 occurred in only 6.7% of cases. However, these studies were conducted in liveborn trisomy 21-affected infants, and the possible impact of fetal death was not taken into account. Using nine distinct DNA polymorphisms, we tested 110 families with a prenatally diagnosed trisomy 21 fetus. Of the 102 informative cases, parental origin was maternal in 91 cases (89.2%) and paternal in 11 (10.8%). This percentage differs significantly from the 7.0% observed in previous studies (P<0.001). In order to test the influence of genomic parental imprinting, we determined the origin of the extra chromosome 21 in relation to different factors: advanced maternal age, maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hormone of placental origin), severity of the disease, gestational age at diagnosis and fetal gender. We found that the increased frequency of paternal origin of nondisjunction in trisomy 21-affected fetuses cannot obviously be explained by factors leading to selective loss of paternal origin fetuses.
