Chromosomal mosaicisms during prenatal diagnosis.
Chromosomal mosaicism during prenatal diagnosis has been a major concern. Nondisjunctional events can lead to mosaicism in a number of ways, including failure of chromosomal pairing, failure to separate, anaphase lag and abnormal segregation. We provide a concise review on various types of mosaicism with their clinical significance.
