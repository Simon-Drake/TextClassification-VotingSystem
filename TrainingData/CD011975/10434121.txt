Growth curves of children with Down syndrome.
Growth curves of 105 children with Down syndrome (50 boys and 55 girls) were established. At birth height, weight and head circumference of Down syndrome children were lower than these parameters in controls. This delay remained stable until puberty. For weight there was no clear-cut pubertal growth spurt. For stature, the prepubertal growth spurt occurred earlier (at the age of 11 years in boys and 9 1/2 years in girls) than in controls but was less marked. As a result, Down syndrome patients had a short stature with a quite normal weight. These reference curves, available since prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome is performed routinely, are helpful for monitoring normal and abnormal development in Down syndrome patients.
