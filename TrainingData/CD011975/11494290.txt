Karyotypes found in the population declared at increased risk of Down syndrome following maternal serum screening.
Of the 65 328 pregnancies of South Australian mothers screened by the South Australian Maternal Serum Antenatal Screening (SAMSAS) Programme between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 1997, 3431 (5.25%) were declared at increased risk of fetal Down syndrome. Fetal or neonatal karyotype was determined in 2737/3431 (79.8%) of these pregnancies, including 16 with early fetal loss. Interrogation of the database of the South Australian Neonatal Screening Service showed 643 live-born infants whose phenotype was not subsequently questioned among the 694 pregnancies whose karyotype was not determined. Of the remaining 51/3431 pregnancies, 19 ended in early fetal loss without karyotyping and no newborn screening or other records could be found for 32 cases. The 129 instances of abnormal karyotype found were Down syndrome (84), trisomy 18 (four), trisomy 13 (three), triploidy (two), female sex chromosome aneuploidy (six) and male sex chromosome aneuploidy (five), inherited balanced rearrangements (19), mosaic or de novo balanced abnormalities (four) and unbalanced karyotypes (two). In the pregnancies declared at increased risk of fetal Down syndrome, only the karyotype for Down syndrome occurred with a frequency greater than that expected for the general, pregnant population.
