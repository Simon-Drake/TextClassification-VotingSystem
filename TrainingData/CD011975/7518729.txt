Antenatal maternal serum profiles.
Since the late 1970s antenatal biochemical screening for pregnancies associated with neural tube defects has become a routine part of obstetric practice in the UK. More recently, biochemical screening programmes for chromosomal anomalies such as trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) and trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome) have moved on from the research stage and have begun to be implemented.
