Evaluation of routine prenatal ultrasound examination in detecting fetal chromosomal abnormalities in a low risk population.
Prenatal diagnosis performed by fetal ultrasound scan is now a routine part of antenatal care in many countries. We have used our registry of congenital malformations to determine how many fetal anomalies and consequently how many chromosomal abnormalities are detected by this procedure. In our region, evaluation of prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities in women of 38 years and younger (chromosomal prenatal diagnosis is offered to women > or = 38 years) with no personal or familial history of chromosomal anomaly was performed in 119,099 consecutive pregnancies of known outcome from 1980 to 1987. At least one ultrasonographic examination seeking congenital malformations was performed in more than 95% of the pregnant women studied. The total number of chromosomal anomalies during the study period was 199, 123 of these being Down syndrome. Only 41 (34.5%) of the 119 fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities and congenital malformation examined had been found to have a malformation at ultrasound examination. This low sensitivity was different for the diverse chromosomal abnormalities. Only 10 out of the 54 fetuses with Down syndrome and malformations (18.5%) were detected and only 3 out of 24 (12.5%) atrioventricular canal defects in those trisomic 21 patients were detected. Only 5 out of 11 (45.4%) fetuses with trisomy 13, 13 out of 26 (50.0%) fetuses with trisomy 18, 7 out of 12 patients with monosomy X (58.3%) and 6 out of 27 (22.2%) fetuses with other chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed. Moreover, the time of detection of these anomalies was early enough to allow amniocentesis and termination of pregnancy in the case of a chromosomal abnormality in only 15 out of these 41 patients, including 7 cases of cystic hygroma in fetuses with monosomy X. This low sensitivity is not the result of the quality of the ultrasound equipment. It may be explained by the inadequate qualification of some operators and by the insufficient duration of the routine examination. In conclusion, our study has shown that the sensitivity of the detection of chromosomal abnormalities by routine prenatal ultrasound screening is low. Other screening methods are needed.
