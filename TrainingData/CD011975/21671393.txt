Partial trisomy 8 mosaicism due to a pseudoisodicentric chromosome 8.
Chromosome 8 is the largest autosome in which mosaic trisomy is compatible with life. Constitutional trisomy 8 (T8) is estimated to occur in approximately 0.1% of all recognized pregnancies. The estimated frequency of trisomy 8 mosaicism (T8M), also known as Warkany syndrome, is about 1/25,000 to 50,000 liveborns, and is found to be more prevalent in males than females, 5:1. T8M is known to demonstrate extreme clinical variability affecting multiple systems including central nervous, ocular, cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal. There appears to be little correlation between the level of mosaicism and the extent of the clinical phenotype. Additionally, the exact mechanism that causes the severity of phenotype in patients with T8M remains unknown. We report on a mildly dysmorphic male patient with partial low-level T8M due to a pseudoisodicentric chromosome 8 with normal 6.0 SNP microarray and high resolution chromosome analyses in lymphocytes. The aneuploidy was detected in fibroblasts and confirmed by FISH in lymphocytes. This report elaborates further the clinical variability seen in trisomy 8 mosaicism.
