Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening and fetal chromosome anomalies: is lowering maternal age for amniocentesis preferable?
We have compared the cytogenetic abnormalities diagnosed prenatally in 1,098 patients referred for amniocentesis because of low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) to those of 445 patients whose indication was elevated MSAFP and those of 361 patients who had amniocentesis for "maternal anxiety." Autosomal trisomies, sex chromosome aberrations, and various structural rearrangements were detected in all 3 groups and actually exceeded the age-related incidence estimates. The frequency of chromosome anomalies in cases studied because of "maternal anxiety" with no prior screening was similar to that in the group referred for low MSAFP (1.38 and 1.27%, respectively). A relatively higher frequency (2.02%) was detected in the group whose indication was elevated MSAFP. Maternal serum screening is designed primarily to recalculate risk figures for Down syndrome, but not for other major chromosome abnormalities. The concept of prenatal screening for chromosome aberrations must therefore be reevaluated. We think that efforts should be directed at making amniocenteses more accessible to patients who request it. "Lowering" maternal age limits to 30 would encompass a greater proportion of pregnancies at risk and would be a step toward more effective prenatal diagnosis for chromosome abnormalities.
