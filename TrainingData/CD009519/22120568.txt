Tumor-to-tumor metastasis: lung adenocarcinoma metastasizing to vestibular schwannoma suspected on preoperative [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging.
BACKGROUND: Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is a rare but well-known phenomenon. Among the more than 100 intracranial tumors reported, meningiomas are the most common type, whereas schwannoma is extremely rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a 75-year-old woman with a lung adenocarcinoma that metastasized to a vestibular schwannoma. Tumor-to-tumor metastasis was indicated by preoperative [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is effective in the preoperative diagnosis of rapidly growing cerebellopontine angle tumors in patients with a history of malignancy.
