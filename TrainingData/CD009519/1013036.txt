[Value of echotomography in pleuro-pulmonary pathology].
Echotomography based on the use of ultrasound as a diagnostic tool, little used until now in pleuropulmonary pathology, seems interesting and valuable and diserves to be counted amongst the various paraclinical examinations. Out of a hundred patients, we obtained the following results: -- 91.7% success in the needle biopsies done after echotomography. -- 84.4% success in exploring peripheral pulmonary tumor. -- 100% success in plotting: pleural thickening in which figures obtained with ultrasounds are very close to those obtained directly by needle. Echotomography in pleuropulmonary pathology has the following indications: -- for pleura effusions, pleural thickening and tumors; -- for pulmonary parenchyma: evolving or stable, solid or liquid masses, that are close enough to the thoracic wall; -- for mediastinum: lesions localized in the anterior mediastinum and related to the sternocostal wall. In all these cases echotomography brings valuable complementary information, sometimes allowing the location of fibrohyalin pleural plaques of asbestosis invisible on X rays. By combining a wider experience and the perfectioning of the equipment, this method could become a common practice in pleural pathology and thoracic oncology.
