[Tumor imaging in nuclear medicine].
Tumor imaging in nuclear medicine has been improved by imaging instruments and newly developed radiopharmaceuticals. One of the imaging developments is a SPECT system using three-detector system. Its each detector rotates 120 degrees when SPECT projection data are acquired and we can save the scanning time and get a high resolution image which is less than 10 mm FWHM. About radiopharmaceuticals 99mTc MDP and 57Ga-citrate are used most commonly for detecting early metastatic lesions in the body. 201Tl chloride and 99mTc MIBI as used for cardiac imaging are also used for tumor detection. 111In-DTPA-D-Phe-octreotide are developed for detection of somatostatin receptor and will be used for many kinds of tumor such as small cell lung cancer, meningioma, malignant lymphoma and gastrointestinal hormone producing tumor.
