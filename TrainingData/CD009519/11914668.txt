Tumor localization and image registration of F-18 FDG coincidence detection scans with computed tomographic scans.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of registering routine clinical F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) coincidence detection (CD) scans with computed tomographic (CT) scans for radiation treatment planning and case management. METHODS: F-18 FDG CD and chest CT scans, performed in 10 randomly selected patients with confirmed or possible adenocarcinoma of the lung, were evaluated. The quality of the matches was verified by comparisons of the center-to-center distance between a region of interest (ROI) manually drawn on the CT slice and warped onto the CD slice with an ROI drawn manually directly on the CD slice. In addition, the overlap between the two ROIs was calculated. RESULTS: All 10 F-18 FDG CD and CT scans were registered with good superimposition of soft tissue density on increased radionuclide activity. The center-to-center distance between the ROIs ranged from 0.29 mm to 8.08 mm, with an average center-to-center distance of 3.89 mm +/- 2.42 mm (0.69 pixels +/- 0.34 pixels). The ROI overlap ranged from 77% to 99%, with an average of 90% +/- 5.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the use of F-18 FDG CD shows great promise for the identification of tumors, it shares the same drawbacks as those associated with radiolabeled monoclonal antibody SPECT and ligand-based positron emission tomographic scans in that anatomic markers are limited. This study shows that image registration is feasible and may improve the clinical relevance of CD images.
