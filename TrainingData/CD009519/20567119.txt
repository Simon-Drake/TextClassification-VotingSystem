[A case of gastric carcinoma with lung and liver metastasis successfully treated by mFOLFOX6].
The case is a 66-year-old woman. CT showed multiple metastasis of the liver and lung after operation by colectomy for ascending colon carcinoma. A close inspection showed progressive stomach cancer with lymph node metastasis. Metastasis was considered an effect when it was of colon cancer origin, and treatment by mFOLFOX6 was started. In the results, we confirmed contraction of the liver and lung metastasis and contraction of the regional lymph node metastasis of the stomach by CT. The gastric cancer lesion became only a cicatrix with endoscopic examination. For gastric cancer, the availability of mFOLFOX6 was suggested.
