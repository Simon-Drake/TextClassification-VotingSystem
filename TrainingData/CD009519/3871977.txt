Gallium scanning by conventional imaging and emission computed tomography in the pretreatment evaluation of lung cancer.
Gallium 67 citrate was evaluated with conventional scanning and emission computed tomography (CT) scanning as a method of pretreatment staging of the intrathoracic, especially mediastinal, spread of lung cancer. Of 31 patients with tumours of various histological types, the isotope was concentrated in the primary lesion in all but one. In 10 out of 12 patients who underwent surgical exploration conventional gallium scanning correctly indicated the mediastinum to be clear and identified two other patients with a tumour of the mediastinum not recognised by chest radiography or emission CT gallium scanning. Neither conventional nor emission CT gallium scanning produced false positive images. Conventional gallium scanning can give information about the mediastinum not available from chest radiographs or bronchoscopy.
