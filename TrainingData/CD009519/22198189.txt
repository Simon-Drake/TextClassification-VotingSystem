Durable complete response induced by paclitaxel-nimotuzumab-methotrexate chemotherapy in a patient with metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
A 61-year-old male patient with metastatic poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx to lymph nodes and lung was treated with a third-line chemotherapy regimen of paclitaxel, nimotuzumab and low-dose methotrexate, receiving a total of 30 cycles. The response was complete and maintained at 16 months. Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody used to treat squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. This third-line chemotherapy combination with paclitaxel-nimotuzumab-methotrexate seems to be an active combination and needs further evaluation in clinical trials to validate its use in heavily treated patients.
