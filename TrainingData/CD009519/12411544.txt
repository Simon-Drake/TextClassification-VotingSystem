Usefulness of whole-body (18)F-FDG PET in patients with suspected metastatic brain tumors.
UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of whole-body (18)F-FDG PET imaging in the differentiation of metastatic brain tumor from primary brain tumor and in the localization of the primary lesion in patients with metastatic brain tumor. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 127 patients (77 men, 50 women; mean age +/- SD, 55 +/- 12 y) with brain masses that were suspected to be metastatic brain tumors on radiologic studies: 77 with confirmed metastatic brain tumor and 50 with primary brain tumor. Whole-body (18)F-FDG PET was performed on all patients. When the abnormal lesion was detected outside the brain, we interpreted the brain lesion as metastatic brain tumor. RESULTS: In 61 of the 77 patients with metastatic brain tumor, primary lesions were detected using whole-body (18)F-FDG PET. Of the remaining 16 patients (all false-negative cases), 7 were classified as metastases of unknown origin. In 47 of the 50 patients with primary brain tumor, whole-body (18)F-FDG PET did not show any other abnormal lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of PET for the detection of primary origin were 79.2%, 94.0%, 95.3%, 74.6%, and 85.0%, respectively. The most common primary origin of metastatic brain tumors on PET examination was lung cancer (48/61, 78.7%). The concordance rate between (18)F-FDG PET and conventional radiologic work-up was 80% in identifying primary lesion. Unknown bone or bone marrow metastases and unsuspected distant metastases were found in 14 patients (18%) and 24 patients (31%), respectively, on PET examination. CONCLUSION: Screening the patients with suspected metastatic brain tumors using whole-body (18)F-FDG PET could be helpful in differentiating metastatic brain tumor from primary brain tumor and in detecting the primary lesion.
