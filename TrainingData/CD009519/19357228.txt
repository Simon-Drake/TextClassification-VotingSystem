Measuring response with FDG-PET: methodological aspects.
The use of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for the evaluation of tumor response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy has been studied in a number of malignancies. By imaging tumor metabolism and therapy-related changes, FDG-PET has demonstrated advantages over anatomical imaging in the assessment of treatment response. More recent investigations have indicated that FDG-PET can predict tumor response early during the course of therapy, potentially allowing for early treatment adjustments. The aim of this review is to provide oncologists with a basic knowledge of the practical aspects of PET quantification for treatment.
