Peripheral lung cancer: relationship between multi-slice spiral CT perfusion imaging and tumor angiogenesis and cyclin D1 expression.
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between 16-slice spiral CT perfusion imaging and tumor angiogenesis and cyclin D1 expression in patients with peripheral lung cancer. Fifty-eight patients with peripheral lung cancer underwent 16-slice spiral CT perfusion imaging. The CT perfusion imaging was analyzed for time density curve (TDC), perfusion parametric maps, and the respective perfusion parameters. Correlation between the respective perfusion parameters and immunohistochemical findings of microvessel density measurement and cyclin D1 expression was evaluated.
