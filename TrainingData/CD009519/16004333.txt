[Successful treatment of bronchial mucoepidermoid carcinoma by bronchoplasty].
A 63-year-old man who was pointed out abnormal shadow on chest X-ray admitted to our hospital. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor originated from right upper bronchus and grew into right main bronchus. The tumor was diagnosed as mucoepidermoid carcinoma by bronchoscopic biopsy. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed abnormal uptake localized at the tumor. The standardized uptake values of the tumor 60 minutes after injection were 2.86, and 120 minutes after injection, it increased to 3.97. Right upper lobectomy with bronchoplasty by deep wedge resection of right main bronchus at the orifice of right upper bronchus and lymphadenectomy was performed. Pathological diagnosis was high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma without lymph nodes metastasis which was compatible with FDG-PET. Postoperative course was uneventful.
