Case report of intralobar pulmonary sequestration detected by lung cancer screening with low-dose spiral CT.
A 52-year-old man underwent lung cancer screening with low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) in a medical check-up at the Japanese Red Cross Kumamoto Health Care Center. He was asymptomatic. Chest x-ray on a medical check-up showed no abnormal shadows. CT scans revealed a nodule in the right lower lung, suggestive of its connection to the descending thoracic aorta. A diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration was considered. He was transferred to Kumamoto University Hospital for further examination. Contrast enhanced multidetector CT images demonstrated that a nodule in the right lower lobe and an anomalous artery ran from the descending thoracic aorta, flowed through the right lower lobe and returned to the right inferior pulmonary vein. Intralobar pulmonary sequestration was confirmed by contrast enhanced multidetector CT. We report this case of asymptomatic intralobar pulmonary sequestration diagnosed using contrast enhanced multidetector CT.
