[Application of technetium-99m labelled sandostatin Somatostatin receptor imaging in the detection of lung cancer].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of (99)Tc(m)-sandostatin receptors imaging ((99)Tc(m)-sandostatin) in detection of lung tumors in comparison with fludeoxyglucose F18 dual head coincidence imaging ((18)F-FDG DHC). METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients (40 men, 16 women; mean age: 62 years, range 35 - 80 years) with pulmonary neoplasm were referred for evaluation. All underwent sandostatin scintigraphy using hybrid SPECT/CT. (18)F-FDG DHC imaging was also performed in 23 patients using the same camera. The tumor uptake of (99)Tc(m)-sandostatin and (18)F-FDG DHC were measured respectively and expressed as the ratio of T/Nr and T/Nm. Final clinical diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological study. RESULTS: Out of 56 cases, 46 were confirmed to be malignant and 10 benign. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (99)Tc(m)-sandostatin in diagnosis of lung cancer were 95.7%, 90.0%, 94.6%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPR) was 97.8%, and the negative predictive value (NPR) was 81.8%. In the 23 patients underwent both methods, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of (18)F-FDG DHC were 100%, 60.0%, 82.6%, respectively; the PPR was 76.5%, and the NPR 100%. Out of 13 patients with malignant neoplasms, 6 patients had regional lymph node metastasis, and all of 10 abnormal lymph nodules showed high uptake of FDG, while (99)Tc(m)-sandostatin imaging only 2 regional metastasized lymph nodes in one patient. T/N(r) and T/N(m) were 3.15 +/- 1.30, and 10.61 +/- 4.35 respectively. There was no relationship between sandostatin uptake and glucose metabolism. CONCLUSION: (99)Tc(m)-sandostatin scintigraphy is a promising noninvasive imaging technique for detection of the primary tumor of lung cancer but of limited value in the detection of lymph node metastasis.
