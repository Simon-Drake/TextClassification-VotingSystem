[Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma].
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a multifocal tumor that rarely metastasizes. It is difficult to diagnose and is most often an incidental finding in young asymptomatic women. It has a heterogeneous radiologic pattern. The most important diagnostic information is histologic confirmation of Weibel-Palade bodies or immunohistochemistry based on specific tumor markers such as factor VIII and CD34. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman in whom multiple pulmonary nodules detected by chance in a radiograph were subsequently diagnosed as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.
