[Clinicopathologic analysis of small-sized non-small cell lung cancer].
We reviewed the data on 149 patients who underwent complete resection for small-sized (</= 2 cm)peripheral non-small cell lung cancer at our institution between January 2002 and July 2010. Patients with small-sized lung cancer underwent a lobectomy in 121, segmentectomy in 13, and wedge resection in 15 cases. The overall and 5-year disease-free survivals were 89% and 82%, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival of patients with tumors exceeding 1.5 cm was lower than that of patients with tumors 1.5 cm or smaller (p=0.01). The 5-year disease-free survival for patients without pleulal invasion was 87%, whereas it was 45% for those with pleulal invasion (p=0.004). The 5-year disease-free survival according to the serum level of carcinoembrionic antigen( CEA) were 82% for the normal group and 70% for the high group( p=0.007). Although the results were not significantly different, patients with tumors with high maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) on FDG-PET/CT showed a trend toward a lower 5-year disease-free survival rate( p=0.10). There were no recurrences in patients with ground-glass opacity (GGO) or GGO-dominant lesion including those who underwent sublober resection. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor size and pleural invasion were independent prognostic factors. Indication of sublober resection for solid-type small-sized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) should be carefully determined considering tumor size, pleural involvement, serum carcinoembryonic antigen( CEA) level, and maximum SUV.
