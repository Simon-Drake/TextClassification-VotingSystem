[F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in lung lesions].
Positron emission tomography (PET) is used in an increasing number of patients for the evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodes as well as for staging and restaging of lung cancer. It adds metabolic information to the anatomical images of CT and may lead to significant cost savings as well in primary diagnostics as in restaging if patients are carefully selected.
