[Early diagnosis of lung cancer].
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in mankind, with five-year survival rate remains 10%. Previous screening trials using chest radiography and cytological examination of sputum failed to reach the goal of a diagnostic screening test,a decrease in lung cancer mortality. With the development of new kinds of technology, there has been a resurgent interest in screening for lung cancer. We reviewed recent diagnosis of early detection of lung cancer including low-dose CT, Thin-Prep cytology, laser- induced fluorescence endoscope and molecular pathology.
