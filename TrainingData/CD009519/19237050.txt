Diagnostic and prognostic values of FDG-PET in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to address the efficacy of 2-[F-18]-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in prognostic prediction in patients with NSCLC. METHODS: Forty-four patients (26 males, 18 females) were analyzed. RESULTS: Accurate staging was obtained by addition of FDG-PET. Multivariate analysis indicated that the standardized uptake value of the primary tumor was the most significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P=.0073). CONCLUSION: FDG-PET is useful for the diagnosis of NSCLC and for prognostic prediction in patients with NSCLC.
