Primary pulmonary paraganglioma with Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Extra-adrenal paragangliomas are uncommon tumors arising from neuroectodermal-derived paraganglionic tissue. There are very few case reports on primary pulmonary paraganglioma in the literature. We present the case of a 21-year-old man who was treated with chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Only a partial response was noted so he underwent additional chemotherapy and involved field radiotherapy. PET-CT showed pathological activity in the lung parenchyma. Subsequent bronchoscopic biopsy showed paraganglioma and the patient underwent a left lower lobectomy.
