Successful salvage treatment of recurrent endometrial cancer with multiple lung and abdominal metastases.
The prognosis of recurrent endometrial carcinoma is generally poor except for isolated vaginal or pelvic relapse without previous radiation. Recurrences associated with infield failure or distant metastasis carry a poor prognosis. We report a case of recurrent endometrial carcinoma treated with cytoreductive surgery, targeted radiation to lung metastasis defined by CT and PET and adjuvant chemo-hormone therapy followed by maintenance progestin therapy with a good outcome. This case implied that chemo-hormone therapy with targeted radiation should be evaluated in recurrent endometrial cancer with positive progesterone receptor for salvage treatment.
