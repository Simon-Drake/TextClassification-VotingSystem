Experimental study of 99mTc-depreotide preparation and its affinity with A549 cell.
The (99m)Tc-labeled agent, ((99m)TcO)depreotide, has received regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for use in the detection of cancer. It is essential to establish a simple and reliable method of direct radiolabeling of (99m)Tc-depreotide and to investigate its specific receptor binding properties with human non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cell in vitro. So we made some researches as follow: Depreotide was labeled with (99m)Tc using SnCl2 as a reductant. Labeling efficiencies at different pH values and temperatures were compared. Radioreceptor assay was used to observe the uptake kinetics, stagnation and retention half time of (99m)Tc-depreotide in A549 cells. As the results of the investigation ,many facts is shown below: The labeling rate of pH 6.0 group was higher than that of pH 5.0 and pH7.0 groups. The labeling rate decreased when temperature increased from 15 degrees C to 50 degrees C. The uptake rate increased with rising temperature, and the maximum uptake was observed at 60 min at 37 degrees C. The cleaning curves were similar at different temperatures, and the half cleaning time at 37 degrees C was 48 min. The results showed that the optimal conditions for labeling depreotide with (99m)Tc was found to be below 15 degrees C at a pH lower than 6.0. Furthermore, at 37 degrees C, (99m)Tc-depreotid may have the potential as an ideal imaging agent for somatostatin receptors.
