Endometrioma presenting as a cavitary lung mass with intense 18F-FDG uptake on PET-CT.
[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography computed tomography is a useful tool to suggest the diagnosis of malignant processes. However, false positive results are known to occur in benign lesions that have a high metabolic activity. Here we describe the unusual diagnosis of a pulmonary endometrioma in a 47-year-old woman, presenting as a cavitary lung mass with intense (18)F-FDG uptake on PET-CT.
