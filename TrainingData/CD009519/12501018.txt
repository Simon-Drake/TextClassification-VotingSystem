Staging of recurrent and advanced lung cancer with 18F-FDG PET in a coincidence technique (hybrid PET).
The aim of this study was to evaluate [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG) imaging of recurrent or inoperable lung cancer using a hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) device of the third generation. Examinations were compared with the results of conventional staging. Thirty-six patients suffering from recurrent or primarily inoperable lung cancer (29 men, seven women; age 64.8+/-12.0 years) were examined using hybrid PET (Marconi Axis gamma-PET ) 60 min after injection of 370 MBq F-FDG. The data obtained were reconstructed iteratively. All patients received a computed tomography (CT) scan using either the spiral or multislice technique. All lesions suspicious for primary or recurrent tumour were verified by biopsy; mediastinal lymph nodes were considered as malignant, when positive histology or a small axis diameter of greater than 1 cm measured with CT in addition to progression of clinical course was found. Distant metastases were diagnosed by CT and bone scintigraphy. Using hybrid PET all lesions showed a focally elevated glucose metabolism. Lymph node involvement of the ipsilateral peribronchial and hilar station (N1) was identified in 24/26 cases (92%), in 26/29 cases (90%) of ipsilateral central manifestation (N2) and in 11/13 (85%) cases of central contralateral or supraclavicular lymphatic infestation (N3). Pulmonary spread in hybrid PET was found in 4/8 cases (50%), whereas mainly lung metastases with a diameter of 1.5 cm and smaller were missed. Pleural involvement diagnosed by CT was verified in 4/5 patients. All four patients with bony metastases in conventional staging also presented with positive findings in hybrid PET (8/9 lesions). Concordance with conventional staging was found in 28/36 of patients (78%). In 4/36 patients (11%) unknown sites of tumour were detected leading to therapeutic consequences in three patients after radiological confirmation. Hybrid PET would have led to an understaging in four cases (11%), resulting theoretically in inefficient treatment in two patients. Hybrid PET for F-FDG imaging in the staging of recurrent or primarily inoperable lung cancer supplied equal (78%) or more information (11%) compared to conventional staging procedures. Using the information of hybrid PET alone, 11% of the patients would have been understaged. We conclude that hybrid PET has the potential for use as an additional staging tool in this subgroup of patients, providing supplementary information compared to conventional staging modalities.
