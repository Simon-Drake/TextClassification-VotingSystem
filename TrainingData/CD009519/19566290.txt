In-vivo imaging of murine tumors using complete-angle projection fluorescence molecular tomography.
We interrogate the ability of free-space fluorescence tomography to image small animals in vivo using charge-coupled device (CCD) camera measurements over 360-deg noncontact projections. We demonstrate the performance of normalized dual-wavelength measurements that are essential for in-vivo use, as they account for the heterogeneous distribution of photons in tissue. In-vivo imaging is then showcased on mouse lung and brain tumors cross-validated by x-ray microcomputed tomography and histology.
