[Clinical assessment of 99mTc-HMPAO scintigraphy in thoracic tumors].
99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amineoxime (99mTc-HMPAO) scintigraphy was performed in 15 malignant tumors in 11 patients and a patient with bronchopneumonia. A high 99mTc-HMPAO affinity for the tumors was observed on SPECT, however, the mean tumor/contralateral normal lung ratios of 99mTc-HMPAO activity (1.26) was lower than that of 201Tl-chloride (2.29). 99mTc-HMPAO uptake was seen not only in the tumors but also in the bronchopneumonia, atelectasis, and irradiated lung (containing radiation fibrosis). Moreover, a diffuse uptake in the lung was seen in a patient received repeated chemotherapy. Therefore, it is emphasized that there is a non-specific 99mTc-HMPAO uptake in those various pulmonary conditions.
