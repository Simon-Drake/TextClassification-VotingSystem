Impact of computed tomography-positron emission tomography fusion in staging patients with thoracic malignancies.
BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) has been demonstrated to improve staging in patients with thoracic malignancies. This study evaluates the ability of a new imaging technique to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of PET. METHODS: Patients with known or suspected malignancy (n = 21) who were referred for a dedicated PET scan were also evaluated with a new camera-based PET system, which uniquely allows simultaneous computed tomography (CT) and fusion of the camera-based PET images with the CT images. The dedicated PET scan was obtained 1 hour after intravenous injection of fluorodeoxyglucose. The camera-based PET imaging was fused with the CT images at approximately 2 hours after injection. The camera-based PET and CT-PET fusion images were read independently and blindly by 2 experienced observers and the presence and location of abnormalities was compared with dedicated PET scans. RESULTS: Dedicated PET identified 18 sites in the chest as abnormal. The CT-PET fusion was superior to the camera-based PET alone, concordant with the dedicated PET in 16 of 21 patients compared with 13 of 21 by camera-based PET. The lesions missed by the camera-based PET were less than 1 cm in diameter. Fused CT-PET images provided superior anatomic localization and spatial resolution compared with dedicated PET and camera-based PET. CONCLUSIONS: CT-PET fusion images were more accurate than camera-based PET alone. CT-PET fusion improves the spatial resolution compared with dedicated PET and may improve the availability and efficacy of staging of patients with thoracic malignancies.
