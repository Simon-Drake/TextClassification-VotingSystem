[Value of 18F-FETNIM PET-CT for detection of tumor hypoxia in non-small-cell lung cancer].
OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of [(18)F]fluoroerythronitroimidazole ((18)F-FETNIM) with integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging in detection of hypoxia in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: Forty-two patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC underwent (18)F-FETNIM PET-CT before treatment. Nineteen patients rested for approximately 120 minutes before undergoing PET-CT, 23 patients underwent 2 sequential PET-CT scans at 60 minutes and 120 minutes after intravenous injection (18)F-FETNIM. (18)F-FETNIM uptake was quantified by calculating the maximum standardized uptake value in the tumor (SUVmax-T) and contralateral normal lung tissue (SUVmax-N). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in the tumor and contralateral position and the radioactivity ratio of tumor to normal (T/N) was calculated. RESULTS: SUVmax-T (2.43 +/- 1.34) was significantly higher than SUVmax-N (0.87 +/- 0.46, P < 0.001) at 120 min. SUVmax-T (2.80 +/- 1.09) and SUVmax-N (1.16 +/- 0.56) at 60 min were significantly higher than SUVmax-T (2.61 +/- 1.10) and SUVmax-N (P < 0.01) at 120 min. T/N (2.56 +/- 0.71) at 60 min was higher than that at 120 min (2.48 +/- 0.60), but the difference between them was not significant (P = 0.324). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that (18)F-FETNIM PET-CT may be a useful tool for evaluating hypoxia and may be a means to target specifically tumor cells resistant to conventional treatment before and during ongoing therapy in NSCLC.
