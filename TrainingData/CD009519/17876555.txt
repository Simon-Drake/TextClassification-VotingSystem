False-positive FDG-PET scan secondary to lipoid pneumonia mimicking a solid pulmonary nodule.
Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning is useful in evaluating suspicious lesions of the lung. Our patient was a 65-year-old woman with a 45-pack-year smoking history who was referred for further evaluation because of a 3 cm x 3 cm solid lung nodule on computed tomography scan of the chest. FDG-PET scan revealed a standard uptake value of 3.2 suggestive of malignancy. The histology of the lung nodule was consistent with lipoid pneumonia, a benign condition frequently associated with inadvertent aspiration or inhalation of oily substances.
