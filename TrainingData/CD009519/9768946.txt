Detection of extrathoracic metastases by positron emission tomography in lung cancer.
BACKGROUND: Accurate staging of non-small cell lung cancer is essential for treatment planning. We evaluated in a prospective study the role of whole-body 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in mediastinal nodal staging with a positive predictive value of 96%. The study was continued to further evaluate the value of whole-body FDG PET in detecting unexpected extrathoracic metastases (ETMs) in patients qualifying for surgical treatment by conventional staging. METHODS: One hundred patients underwent clinical evaluation, chest and upper abdominal computed tomography scan, mediastinoscopy (lymph nodes greater than 1 cm on computed tomography), and routine laboratory tests. In 94 patients with stage IIIa or less and 6 with suspected N3 a whole-body FDG PET was performed. If clinical signs of ETMs were present additional diagnostic methods were applied. All findings in the FDG PET were confirmed histologically or radiologically. RESULTS: Unexpected ETMs were detected in 13 (14%) of 94 patients (stage IIIa or less) at 14 sites. In addition 6 of 94 patients were restaged up to N3 after PET. The suspected N3 disease (stage IIIb) on computed tomography was confirmed by PET in all 6 patients. There was no false positive finding of ETM. Weight loss was correlated with the occurrence of ETM: more than 5 kg, 5 of 13 patients (38%); more than 10 kg, 4 of 6 patients (67%). Pathologic laboratory findings were not predictive for ETM. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body FDG PET improves detection of ETMs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer otherwise elegible for operation. In 14% of patients (stage IIIa or less), ETMs were detected, and in total, 20% of the patients were understaged.
