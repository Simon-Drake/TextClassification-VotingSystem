[Xeroradiographic scanning in clinical oncology].
A combined method of xeroradiographic scanning (ERS) was used for the recognition of tumors of different organs. Altogether 645 cancer patients were investigated: 98 with head and neck tumors, 102--with pulmonary and mediastinal tumors, 254--with liver tumors, 86--with renal tumors, 52--with bone tumors, and 53--with prostatic tumors. Special methods of investigation and tumoritropic radiopharmaceuticals 75Se-methionine, 67Ga-citrate, 85Sr, 113In, 99Tc, etc. were used. Statistical data processing was done using Olivetti computer M-24. ERS was shown to be the most effective method for the detection of cancer of the lung mediastinum (90%), head and neck (89%), and prostate (89%). The method is particularly valuable for tumors developing in anatomical regions inaccessible for examination, biopsy, and x-ray findings are not sufficiently clear. The use of ERS excludes possible errors in diagnosing disease on the edges of an organ, especially in liver and kidney investigation. The method also proved to be valuable for the assessment of therapeutic efficacy and correction of fields of irradiation.
