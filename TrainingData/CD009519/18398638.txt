When coughing can cause stroke--a case-based update on cerebral air embolism complicating biopsy of the lung.
Introducing gas to the circulation is a largely iatrogenic problem which can result in serious morbidity and even death. We report a case of CT-guided needle biopsy of a pulmonary lesion complicated by acute stroke. The English literature on cerebral air embolism is reviewed, including an update of current opinions on its pathomechanism, diagnostic findings, therapeutic strategies, and means of prevention.
