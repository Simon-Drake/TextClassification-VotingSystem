[CT characteristics of primary salivary gland-type lung cancer].
OBJECTIVE: To improve the diagnostic accuracy of primary salivary gland-type lung cancer on CT. METHODS: The CT findings of 13 pathologically proven primary salivary gland-type lung cancers (mucoepidermoid carcinoma, n = 8, adenoid cystic carcinoma, n = 5) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Three mucoepidermoid carcinomas were located in the main bronchus, 4 in segmental bronchus, and 1 in peripheral lung. Intrabronchial nodule or mass with smooth or lobulated margin and punctuate or strip calcification (n = 2) was the main CT feature. The tumor showed moderate to significant enhancement after the administration of contrast medium. Three adenoid cystic carcinomas involved trachea, and 2 involved the main and lobular bronchi. The main CT features were diffuse or circumferential irregular thickness of the wall, distorted lumen, and nodule protruding into the lumen, and the longitudinal extent of the tumor was greater than its transverse axis. CONCLUSION: The CT findings of primary salivary gland-type lung cancer are rather specific and may provide helpful information for the clinical diagnosis and treatment.
