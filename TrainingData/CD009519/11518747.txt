Pulmonary intravascular lymphoma complicated with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia: a case report.
We report a case of intravascular lymphoma (IVL) complicated with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). A 65-year-old male complaining of dyspnea and dementia was diagnosed to have pulmonary IVL by transbronchial lung biopsy. Concomitantly, deoxyribonucleic acid sequence specific to Pneumocystis carinii was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by polymerase chain reaction. Differential responses to the sequential treatments for PCP and IVL implied that increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was due to PCP, whereas hypoxemia and dementia were due to IVL. Although pulmonary IVL and PCP share many clinical presentations, exact diagnosis is essential for their successful treatment.
