Initial evaluation of pulmonary abnormalities: CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy and fluoride-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography correlation.
Fluoride-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can evaluate patients with new pulmonary lesions. CT-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is a well-described method in the diagnosis of pulmonary lesions. In order to correlate results from these testing modalities, retrospective findings from FNA biopsies of pulmonary lesions are compared to concurrent FDG-PET scans. Files of the Saint Louis University Hospital were retrospectively searched for patients with CT-guided FNA biopsies of the lung during a consecutive 3-yr period. Patients were collected, and corresponding FDG-PET scans were identified. Only new pulmonary lesions presenting for initial evaluation were included. Findings were correlated. Forty patients with a total number of 41 CT-guided FNA biopsies of the lung and thoracic cavity had corresponding FDG-PET scans. The combined positivity of the two testing modalities, i.e., cases where both FNA and FDG-PET scan were positive, yielded a sensitivity of 100% (37/37). Four patients had infectious/inflammatory processes by CT-guided FNA biopsy that were FDG-PET-positive for malignancy. CT-guided FNA biopsies with FDG-PET scans of pulmonary lesions are important, complementary diagnostic tools which can contribute significantly to the management and treatment of pulmonary disease.
