[Comparative values of different imaging methods in lung cancer screening].
Radiology is the primary lung cancer screening technique. Whether the mortality rate of lung cancer could be markedly reduce by radiological screening was still unknown to us. It was suggested that high-risk individuals should take regular radiological examinations to detect early lung cancers, followed by suitable treatment. In this review, we compared the values of different radiological methods in lung cancer screening.
