Role of surgery in a multidisciplinary approach to superior sulcus tumors (SST): morbidity and prognostic factors for long-term success after resection.
BACKGROUND: Optimal management of SST is still controversial several years after the proposal of a multidisciplinary approach including neoadjuvant chemotherapy and external radiation. Our objective is to report our experience of this multidisciplinary approach from the surgical point of view. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1997 to January 2008, 24 patients were treated surgically (18 with induction chemotherapy and 15 with radiotherapy). The surgical approach was thoracic (14 cases, 1 with a spinal approach) or cervical (10 patients, 2 thoracotomies). Pulmonary surgery performed consisted of 11 wedge resections, 10 lobectomies, 1 pneumonectomy and 2 cases without lung resection (1 exploratory thoracotomy and 1 local progression after a previously resected tumor). Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) was given in 7 cases. Partial vertebral body resection was performed in 5 cases. A pathologically complete response (pT0) was found in 7 cases (29 %). RESULTS: Surgery-related morbidity was mainly due to respiratory distress (5 patients). Two patients died in the first month after surgery (mortality: 8 %). The surgical approach (cervical vs. thoracic) did not influence postoperative morbidity ( p = NS). Overall 5-year survival was 56.6 % according to the Kaplan-Meier method. No influence on survival was observed with regard to the approach (cervical vs. thoracic), the use of IORT, or the performance of spinal surgery. Patients with a complete pathological response had a better 5-year survival, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Surgery has a role in the multidisciplinary approach, especially when we consider long-term survival. A multidisciplinary approach using neoadjuvant chemo and radiotherapy has a high rate of complete pathological response. It is also associated with a high incidence of postoperative distress syndrome. The 5-year survival is acceptable.
