Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from meningioma: report of a case.
Meningiomas rarely metastasize, and little information on pulmonary metastasectomy from meningioma has been documented. We herein report a case of a potentially curative resection for meningioma that metastasized to the lung. A 67-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of two masses in the right lung. In 1993, when the patient was 52 years old, she underwent a craniotomy for an atypical meningioma. The meningioma recurred once in the local site and was re-excised in 1997. In 2008, a screening chest X-ray detected two lung nodules in the right lung field. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated round masses with sharp borders, in the right S2 (2.2 cm in diameter) and S4 (1.1 cm in diameter) regions. A whole-body [(18)F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/CT examination revealed intense focal FDG uptake (maximum standard uptake value [SUV(max)] = 6.9) in the larger mass, and weak FDG uptake (SUV(max) = 2.3) in the smaller mass. A wedge resection of S2 and a middle lobectomy of the right lung were performed, and the final diagnosis was pulmonary metastases from an intracranial meningioma. The patient is presently doing well 20 months after the surgery without any signs of recurrence. Our case demonstrates that surgery should be considered when pulmonary metastases are deemed completely resectable by a preoperative radiological examination, and that a good clinical outcome can be achieved.
