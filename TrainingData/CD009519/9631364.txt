The contribution of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomographic imaging to radiotherapy planning in lung cancer.
A retrospective analysis was performed to determine whether coronal thoracic [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans, if viewed at the time of radiotherapy (RT) planning, would have influenced the anterior-posterior (AP) RT volumes that were administered to a group of unoperated lung cancer patients. Viewing of PET and diagnostic images enabled a qualitative assessment of whether abnormal thoracic PET activity was present in areas regarded as normal by diagnostic imaging; this would, therefore, have influenced the RT volume if done prospectively. Additionally a method of graphical co-registration was devised to quantitate the adequacy of coverage of each patient's abnormal PET activity by his/her actual RT field. Of 15 patients analyzed, 26.7% (four patients) would have had their RT volume influenced by PET findings, highlighting the potential value of PET in treatment planning.
