[Current approach to bronchial carcinoid tumors].
Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung comprise typical and atypical carcinoids, as well as large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas and small cell carcinomas. However carcinoid tumours differ from the latter two by their clinical presentation, radiographic, histological appearances, and treatment modalities as well as prognosis. In this paper we review these features and discuss the role of new imaging modalities such as PET scan.
