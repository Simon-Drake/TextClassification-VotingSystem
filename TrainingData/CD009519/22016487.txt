Reversed halo sign: high-resolution CT scan findings in 79 patients.
BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan findings of patients with the reversed halo sign (RHS) and to identify distinguishing features among the various causes. METHODS: Two chest radiologists reviewed the HRCT scans of 79 patients with RHS and determined the CT scan findings by consensus. We studied the morphologic characteristics, number of lesions, and presence of features associated with RHS. RESULTS: Forty-one patients presented with infectious diseases (paracoccidioidomycosis, TB, zygomycosis, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis), and 38 presented with noninfectious diseases (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, sarcoidosis, edema, lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma [formerly bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma], granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener]). The RHS walls were smooth in 58 patients (73.4%) and nodular in 21 patients (26.6%). Lesions were multiple in 40 patients (50.6%) and single in 39 patients (49.4%). CONCLUSION: The presence of nodular walls or nodules inside the halo of the RHS is highly suggestive of granulomatous diseases.
