Increased (18)fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type lymphoma of the lung.
The authors report a case of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type lymphoma of the lung that showed an increased accumulation of 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on positron emission tomography. It should be considered that MALT-type lymphoma could be cause a increased FDG uptake in the lung.
