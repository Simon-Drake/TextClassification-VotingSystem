Reproducibility of semi-quantitative parameters in FDG-PET using two different PET scanners: influence of attenuation correction method and examination interval.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the reproducibility of semi-quantitative parameters obtained from two 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies using two different PET scanners. METHODS: Forty-five patients underwent FDG-PET examination with two different PET scanners on separate days. Two PET images with different attenuation correction method were generated in each patient, and three regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on the lung tumor and normal organs (mediastinum and liver) in each image. Mean and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs), tumor-to-mediastinum and tumor-to-liver ratios (T/M and T/L), and the percentage difference in parameters between two PET images (% Diff.) were compared. RESULTS: All measured values except maximum SUV in the liver and tumor-related parameters (SUV in lung tumor, T/M, T/L) showed no significant difference between two PET images. CONCLUSION: The mean measured values showed high reproducibility and demonstrate that follow-up study or measurement of tumor response to anticancer drugs can be undertaken by FDG-PET examination without specifying the particular type of PET scanner.
