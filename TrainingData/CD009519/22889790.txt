Superscan-like hypermetabolic lesions on delayed FDG PET/CT imaging in a patient with lung cancer.
A 69-year-old man with a lung mass underwent multiple-time-point FDG PET/CT imaging for diagnostic evaluation. The initial PET imaging (performed at 1 hour after tracer injection) revealed equivocal bone marrow uptake in the right iliac bone and proximal femurs in addition to lung and mediastinal lesions. The 3-hour delayed PET imaging, however, demonstrated widespread bone marrow metastases. Biopsies of the right lung mass and right iliac bone marrow were later performed and revealed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in both sites. This case indicates the value of delayed FDG PET in detecting superscan-like hypermetabolic bone marrow lesions in patients with lung cancer.
