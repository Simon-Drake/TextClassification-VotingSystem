Pulmonary amyloidosis mimicking multiple metastatic lesions on F-18 FDG PET/CT.
We report a case of amyloid pulmonary nodules with positive FDG uptake that mimic multiple lung metastases. A 54-year-old female patient was referred for the evaluation of multiple lung nodules. A PET/CT scan revealed mild FDG uptake in various sized pulmonary nodules. Resected nodules contained amorphous eosinophilic proteineous material with focal calcification, consistent with amyloidosis. Pulmonary amyloidosis should be added to the differential diagnosis for cases of multiple pulmonary nodules that show positive FDG uptake.
