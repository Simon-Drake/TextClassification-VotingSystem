Lung parasite ova granuloma mimicking lung malignancy on FDG PET-CT.
A 60-year-old lady with mild fever, blood tinged sputum, and a left upper lung mass had whole body F-18 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-computer tomography (CT) for cancer staging. The PET-CT imaging revealed FDG accumulation in the left upper lung lesion. The histopathology of the left upper lobe lung resection showed a parasite tunnel with necrosis, parasite ova, and foreign body giant cells. After surgery, eosinophiles in the peripheral blood dropped from 20% of white cell counts before operation to 5.5% at 7 weeks postoperation.
