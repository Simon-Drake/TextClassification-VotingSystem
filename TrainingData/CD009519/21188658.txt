18F-FDG-PET/CT findings in primary pulmonary mixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma.
A 55-year-old female had an abnormal shadow on chest radiograph. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 26-mm tumor mass in the left upper lobe. No malignant findings were obtained by bronchoscopic cytology or histopathological diagnostics, but on positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) examination the maximum SUV was 9.01 in accordance with the tumor mass shadow on CT. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed as clinically suspected of lung cancer, and the diagnosis was pulmonary mixed squamous cell and glandular papilloma (PMSGP). Primary PMSGP is extremely rare, and this is the first to describe the PET findings of this disease.
