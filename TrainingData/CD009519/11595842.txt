Focal pulmonary uptake during Tc-99m myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence and origin of abnormal focal pulmonary uptake during myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging (MSPECT). METHODS: For evaluation of chest pain, 790 men and 581 women (mean age, 56 +/- 13 years) underwent MSPECT. All of them received adenosine for pharmacologic stress and Tc-99m tetrofosmin (TF, n = 817) or Tc-99m sestamibi (MIBI, n = 554) for myocardial perfusion imaging. RESULTS: Review of chest radiography with or without computed tomography revealed 111 (8.1%) focal pulmonary diseases. Among them, 38 (34.2%) showed focal pulmonary uptake (TF, 22; MIBI, 16); 27 (30.7%) of 88 showed previous pulmonary tuberculosis; 2 of 10 (20%) benign pulmonary nodules; 4 of 5 (80%) metastatic lung cancers; 2 of 4 (50%) primary lung cancers; and 3 of 4 (75%) pneumonias. No difference in uptake was noted for the two imaging agents. Intensity of uptake did not vary with origin of the uptake. Focal abnormal pulmonary uptake was found in 2.8% of patients undergoing MSPECT and in 34.2% of patients in whom radiological examinations showed regional pulmonary disease. In patients with abnormal pulmonary uptake on MSPECT, 16% had a malignant lesion, whereas 75% of patients with a pulmonary nodule shown on radiography and focal pulmonary uptake on MSPECT had a malignant lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of abnormal pulmonary uptake during MSPECT was very low, the incidence of malignant lesions in the patients with nodular pulmonary uptake was relatively high.
