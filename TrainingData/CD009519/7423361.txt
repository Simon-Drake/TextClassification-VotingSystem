Radiologic diagnosis of chest disease.
Our purpose has been to provide a cursory review of radiologic diagnosis of noncardiac chest diseases. We have discussed several important diagnostic problems using illustrative cases from our experience. Although we have emphasized the role of computed tomography in solving particularly difficult problems, we still believe that most of the proven conventional techniques provide the best, simplest, and most economical approach to many problems in chest diagnosis. It is also apparent that the overall imaging management of the patient requires a multifaceted approach. The complexities of diagnosis and patient management more than ever require a comprehensive dialogue between radiologist and surgeon. The ultimate beneficiary as far as these technologies and improvements in communications between physicians are concerned is the patient.
