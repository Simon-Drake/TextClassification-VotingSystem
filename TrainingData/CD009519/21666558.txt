Imaging and lung cancer.
Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in Scotland, accounting for 28.9% of all cancer deaths in 2007. Current guidelines recommend assessment of patient fitness and operability by a multidisciplinary team when selecting management options. Two of the most important prognostic markers are the stage of disease and ECOG performance status. In 1996, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) launched a worldwide TNM staging project to create international databases that would be used to continue the excellent efforts of Dr. Cliff Mountain, who pioneered this approach to lung cancer staging in 1973. Successive iterations of tumor, nodule, metastasis (TNM) staging for lung cancer have addressed shortcomings identified by the oncology community. Similarly, the IASLC recognized that it is important that further revisions continue to be made to ensure that the international staging system for lung cancer remains fit for its purpose. The last work of the International Staging Committee (ISC) was the conduct of the study that informed the seventh edition of the international staging system for lung cancer, in 2010. This review of image and staging in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), includes a summary of the different noninvasive tests currently available for staging non small cell lung cancer.
