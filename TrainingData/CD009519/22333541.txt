[Screening of early lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in high-risk populations: a meta-analysis].
OBJECTIVE: To explore the values of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in the screening of high-risk populations for early lung cancer through a meta-analysis of the relevant literature. METHODS: PubMed, EBSCO, Cochrane and other databases were searched with key words. And the studies were selected by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The baseline data were collected and analyzed by statistical software. RESULTS: Ten random controlled trials (RCTs) were selected. Compared to the chest X ray (CXR) screening and no screening controls, LDCT screening had an odds ratio (OR) of 3.705, 95%CI 3.527 - 3.891. And in the subgroup analysis, a higher number of stage I lung cancer was detected (OR 4.464, 95%CI 2.860 - 6.969) by LDCT. Moreover, LDCT screening showed an increased detection of adenocarcinoma in lung cancer (OR 4.652, 95%CI 2.877 - 7.522). CONCLUSION: LDCT is superior to CXR in the early detection of lung cancer, especially stage I and adenocarcinoma.
