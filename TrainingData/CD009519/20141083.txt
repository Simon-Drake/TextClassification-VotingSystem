[Chordoma which was found as a solitary lung tumor].
We report a rare case of chordoma which was found as a well-circumscribed lesion on chest X-ray films without any symptoms, and removed surgically. According to immunohistochemical examination, it has both of epithelial and mesenchymal cell nature, with characteristically positivestaining of S-100. Therefore, it was diagnosed as a lung metastasis of chordoma. The primary focus was unclear in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the whole body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) inspection. The possibility to be primary lung chordoma can not be denied.
