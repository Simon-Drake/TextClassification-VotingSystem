Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor incidentally detected by (18)F-CH PET/CT.
We report the case of a pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor (NET) incidentally detected by F-CH PET/CT performed during restaging in a 68-year-old patient affected by prostate cancer. To clarify the nature of the pulmonary lesion, the patient underwent a CT-guided biopsy which revealed the presence of a pulmonary NET. A subsequent Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT demonstrated the somatostatin receptor expression in the pulmonary lesion. The patient underwent a right lung lobectomy; at pathology, a well-differentiated NET was confirmed. Our case highlights that pulmonary NETs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions showing uptake of radiolabeled choline.
