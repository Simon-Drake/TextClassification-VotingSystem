Positron emission tomography: false positive result due to splenic uptake in an extension study in bronchial carcinoma. A case report.
Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases. Many tests and techniques are used in the staging of this disease, including positron emission tomography. This is probably the most recently introduced test and is capable of providing information on all the structures affected by malignancy. We present a case of a false positive result due to increased splenic uptake of the tracer.
