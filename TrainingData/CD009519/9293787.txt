Technetium-99m-MIBI and thallium-201 scintigraphy of primary lung cancer.
UNLABELLED: We evaluated the usefulness of 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy in primary lung cancer in comparison with 201Tl-chloride scintigraphy. METHODS: There were 45 patients with primary lung cancer. All patients underwent dual-isotope imaging with 201Tl-chloride and 99mTc-MIBI. Regions of interest were placed over the tumors (T) and contralateral normal lung tissue (N) on one coronal view in the SPECT, and T/N ratio and retention index were calculated. RESULTS: The positive rate was 98% in both the early and delayed images for 201Tl-chloride and 96% in the early and 89% in the delayed image for 99mTc-MIBI. Both early and delayed T/N ratios for 201Tl-chloride were higher than those for 99mTc-MIBI. There was no significant correlation between T/N ratio and histological type of tumor in both images. However, in both images, there was a tendency for the early and delayed ratios to increase as the tumor diameter became larger. The retention index of 201Tl-chloride was higher than that of 99mTc-MIBI. There were no significant differences in the retention index with respect to the histological type and tumor size. CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary clinical study suggest that 99mTl-MIBI can depict primary lung cancer similar to 201Tl-chloride. However, T/N ratio and retention index of 99mTc-MIBI in the tumor areas are significantly lower compared with those of 201Tl-chloride.
