Positron emission tomography for benign and malignant disease.
Functional imaging using radiolabeled probes that specifically bind and accumulate in target tissues has improved the sensitivity and specificity of conventional imaging. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) has shown improved diagnostic accuracy in differentiating benign from malignant lesions in the setting of solitary pulmonary nodules. FDG-PET has become useful in preoperative staging of patients with lung cancer, and is being tested with many other malignancies for its ability to change patient management. This article provides an overview of the current status of FDG-PET and presents the challenges of moving toward routine use.
