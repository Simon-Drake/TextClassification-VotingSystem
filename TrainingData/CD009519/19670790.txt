[Endobronchial hamartoma suspected lung cancer due to false positive of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography; report of a case].
A 63-year-old male was referred to our hospital with an abnormal shadow on chest radiography and computed tomography. A transbronchial lung biopsy did not reveal any malignant lesion. A fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was done for further examination and it revealed positive. Right upper lobectomy was perfomed for both diagnosis and treatment. The pathological diagnosis was endobronchial hamartoma The FDG-PET was false positive because of its atelectasis with obstructive pneumonia
