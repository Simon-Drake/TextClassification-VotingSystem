Outcome in patients with lung cancer invisible on chest roentgenograms but detected only by helical computed tomography.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognosis for patients with lung cancer detected by helical CT but not by CXR. One hundred and thirty-seven asymptomatic patients with lung cancer diagnosed by annual mass screening of the chest were enrolled over a 7-year period. Five-year survival rates in patients with lung cancer detected only by helical CT (n = 19: CT-only detection group) and in patients with lung cancer visible by both CXR and helical CT (n = 118: control group) were evaluated, and clinical variables were examined as possible predictors of survival time using the Cox proportional-hazards model. There was a significant difference between the 5-year survival rates in the CT-only detection group and in the control group (80% vs. 39%, log rank: P = 0.0171). The risk of death decreased 77% in CT-only detectable lung cancer (hazard ratio: 0.219, 95% confidence interval: 0.057-0.845, P = 0.0275). Lung cancer could not be seen by CXR because nodules were small or faint (n = 11) or overlapping a shadow of thoracic components (n = 8). The percentage of subsolid nodules (classified as either part-solid or non-solid nodules) was higher in the subgroup with small or faint nodules (82% vs. 25%, P = 0.0423). Helical CT has the ability to detect early lung cancer before the small or faint nodules increase to a size visible on CXR, and patients with lung cancer detected only by helical CT have a better prognosis.
