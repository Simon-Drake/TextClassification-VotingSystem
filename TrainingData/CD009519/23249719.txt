[Correlation between regional node metastasis and imageological characteristics in non-small cell lung cancer].
N staging is a key factor for the choice of treatment modalities in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Both of the noninvasive and invasive N staging procedures have their own limitations. It is reported that some imageological characteristics have predictive value, including tumor size, CT attenuation and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) standardized uptake value (SUV), and so on. It is expected to find the key risk factors with multivariate analysis.
