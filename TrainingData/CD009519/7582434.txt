[The usefulness of 99mTc-tetrofosmin in the diagnosis of pulmonary tumors. A preliminary assessment].
We conducted a preliminary study of captation of the new radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-tetrofosmin in cases of primary carcinoma of the lung, analyzing the results of 5 cases studied before surgery with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) of the lung. The results obtained by imaging were compared with those from surgery. Tumor size ranged between 3.5 and 9 cm. In all cases the images showed that captation of the radiotracer by the neoplasm was satisfactory, leaving the area of the tumor clearly distinguishable from normal adjacent lung tissue and giving no signs of interference caused by absorption of 99mTc-tetrofosmin by contiguous structures (heart or liver). Based on these preliminary results we assert that SPECT of the lung using 99mTc-tetrofosmin may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of malignant lung tumors, although further research must determine to what extent the technique can be relied upon.
