[A suspicious case of metastasis to the stomach from primary lung cancer; report of a case].
A 82-year-old man consulted for therapy for lung cancer in March 2010. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a mass in right lower lobe of the lung. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed the accumulation in the mass. Lung cancer was strongly suspected and anticancer chemotherapy was started. The patient complained of difficulty in swallowing in August 2011. Gastroendoscopy revealed a submucosal mass in the gastric corpus. The specimen from the mass showed gastric metastasis from lung cancer on pathological study. The case of gastric metastasis from lung cancer is rare. When we concern the patient of lung cancer, it should be considered gastric metastasis.
