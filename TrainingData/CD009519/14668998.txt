[Benign and malignant pulmonary tumors in childhood].
Pulmonary tumors in children are rare. Nevertheless, there are besides malign primary neoplasms and metastases also some benign tumors that the radiologist should know. The identification of some tumors is difficult, since some of them may mimic pulmonary inflammation. The first diagnostic tool is chest radiography. After that, a CT with contrast medium should be performed, if possible a multislice-CT (MSCT). Identification of mediastinal structures is best with MRI.
