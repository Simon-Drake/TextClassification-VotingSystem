[Primitive metastasizing bronchial carcinoid with long survival].
BACKGROUND: Metastatic bronchial carcinoid tumours are rare but some patients have a prolonged survival. A new functional imagery now makes it possible to supplement the assessment of the extent of disease. OBSERVATION: A 57 year old patient was referred for dyspnoea on exertion revealing an upper left lobar tumour, with carcinoid syndrome. The assessment enabled to find out a bronchial carcinoid tumour with liver and bone metastases, highlighted by positron-emission tomography and pentetreotide SPECT. A chemotherapy proved to be ineffective and upper left lobectomy was carried out because of the risk of pulmonary atelectasis. The patient was treated by somatostatin analogues then underwent liver transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization. The patient was alive 44 months after diagnosis (56 months after first computed tomography). CONCLUSION: Metastatic bronchial carcinoid tumours are rare. They keep a metastatic potential, the histological type remaining the major prognosis factor. Carcinoid syndrome is suggestive. The assessment of extra-thoracic disease extent benefits by contribution of new functional imagery techniques such as the pentetreotide SPECT and positron-emission tomography. The management is essentially symptomatic since there is no effective chemotherapy. However survival can be prolonged, even in multimetastatic patients.
