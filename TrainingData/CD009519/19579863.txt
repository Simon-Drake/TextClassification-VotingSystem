Changes in glucose metabolism during and after radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.
AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the metabolic response to radiotherapy in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients is commonly performed about three months after the end of radiotherapy. The aim of the present study was to assess with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose changes in glucose metabolism during and after radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: In 6 patients, PET/CT scans with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose were performed before (PET0), during (PET1; at a median of 14 days before the end of radiotherapy) and after the end of radiotherapy (PET2 and PET3, at a median of 28 and 93 days, respectively). The metabolic response was scored according to visual and semiquantitative criteria. RESULTS: Standardize maximum uptake at PET1 (7.9 +/- 4.8), PET2 (5.1 +/- 4.1) and PET3 (2.7 +/- 3.1) were all significantly (P < 0.05; ANOVA repeated measures) lower than at PET0 (16.1 +/- 10.1). Standardized maximum uptake at PET1 was significantly higher than at both PET2 and PET3. There were no significant differences in SUV(max) between PET2 and PET3. PET3 identified 4 complete and 2 partial metabolic responses, whereas PET1 identified 6 partial metabolic responses. Radiotherapy-induced increased [l8F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake could be visually distinguished from tumor uptake based on PET/CT integration and was less frequent at PET1 (n = 2) than at PET3 (n = 6). CONCLUSION: In non-small cell lung cancer, radiotherapy induces a progressive decrease in glucose metabolism that is greater 3 months after the end of treatment but can be detected during the treatment itself. Glucose avid, radiotherapy-induced inflammation is more evident after the end of radiotherapy than during radiotherapy and does not preclude the interpretation of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose images, particularly when using PET/CT.
