[Lung cancer: a review of current knowledge, diagnostic methods and therapeutic perspectives].
All around the world, lung cancer is the most common cancer among men and women, followed by breast, colon and rectum, stomach, and liver cancer. It affects most frequently people in their 50s and 60s, and tobacco consumption is the risk factor most strongly associated to the development of this type of cancer. It is most common among men; however, the prevalence among women has increased over the last ten years. Imaging tests for diagnosis include positron emission tomography (PET) with computed-tomography fusion, and transesophageal and bronchoscopic ultrasound, as the most relevant. Among the early detection techniques, the low-dose helical tomography stands out. However, it has not been able to prove to be useful as a screening tool. Conventional methods for diagnostic confirmation of lung cancer are bronchoscopy and percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy. The most common histologic type is the adenocarcinoma, being clinical stages III and IV being the most frequently found. At early clinical stages, surgical treatment has proven to be effective, and there is a good 5-year survival rate. In late stages, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the most useful treatment methods to control the disease and palliate cancer signs and symptoms. Research in genomic analysis may provide a better understanding of cancer genetics , and therefore, new therapeutic strategies in the future.
