Advances in the staging of intrathoracic malignancies.
Conventional staging of lung and esophageal tumors has consisted of a thorough history and physical examination, screening laboratory studies, computed tomography, and radionuclide imaging. Newer modalities including positron emission scanning, endoscopic ultrasonography, minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy and thoracoscopy), and immunohistochemical staining of lymph node tissue. The role of these techniques are subject to much current debate, and they may ultimately add information that is valuable for staging and optimally treating patients with intrathoracic malignancies.
