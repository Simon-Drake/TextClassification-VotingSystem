Prognostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: single center experience.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective single-center study was to evaluate the prognostic implication on overall survival (OS) of the F-18 FDG PET scan in locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 120 locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients (December 2004-November 2011) treated/followed at the Dicle University, School of Medicine, Department of Medical Oncology. SUVmax and other potential prognostic variables (n=18) were chosen for analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors for OS. RESULTS: Among 18 variables of univariate analysis, 6 were identified to bear prognostic significance: sex (p=0.01), performance status (PS) (p =0.03), stage (p=0.04), bone metastases (p=0.002), serum albumin (p=0.01) and blood glucose level (p=0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that PS, bone metastases and serum albumin level were independent prognostic factors for OS (p=0.01, p=0.004, p=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: PS, serum albumin levels and bone metastases were independent prognostic factors, while FDG uptake of the primary lesion was not associated with prognosis of OS in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients.
