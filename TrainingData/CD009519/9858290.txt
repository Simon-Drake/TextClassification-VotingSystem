Dual isotope F-18 FDG and Tc-99m RBC imaging for lung cancer.
PURPOSE: To produce fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) images with markers for normal organs and large blood vessels in patients with suspected lung cancer. METHODS: Dual isotope SPECT images were made using F-18 FDG- and Tc-99m-labeled autologous red cells. RESULTS: FDG-positive lesions are localized in relation to major structures when they are viewed in a fused rotating three-dimensional display or in cross sections. CONCLUSIONS: Tc-99m red cell and FDG fusion imaging provides relative location information for lung tumors.
