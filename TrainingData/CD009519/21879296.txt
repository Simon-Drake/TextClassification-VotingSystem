The value of (1)(8)F-FDG-PET/CT in the differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules in areas with a high incidence of tuberculosis.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate (18)F-FDG-PET, PET/CT, and CT in the diagnosis of benign or malignant solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) in areas with a high incidence of TB. METHODS: Ninety-six patients with a SPN smaller than 30 mm were studied prospectively. PET/CT images were obtained 60 min after intravenous injection of (18)F-FDG. The data obtained for each patient were analyzed and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated and compared using chi(2) test. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV in the diagnosis of SPN were 86.7, 72.2, 81.3, 83.9, and 76.5%, respectively, for CT and 88.3, 61.1, 79.1, 79.1, and 75.9%, respectively, for PET. Tuberculosis was responsible for 57.1% (8/14) of false-positives on PET. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV in the diagnosis of SPN were 96.7, 75.7, 88.5, 88.1, and 94.4% for PET/CT. The accuracy of PET/CT was higher than that of either CT or PET alone (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PET has a high false-positive rate in areas with a high incidence of TB; combined PET and CT (PET/CT) can improve the diagnostic accuracy in the differentiation of an SPN.
