Intermodality, retrospective image registration in the thorax.
UNLABELLED: The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate, retrospectively applicable procedure for registering thoracic studies from different modalities in a short amount of time and with minimal operator intervention. METHODS: CT and PET studies were acquired from six patients. The pleural surfaces in both image sets were determined by segmenting based on 50% of the maximum soft-tissue value in the study. These surfaces were converted into three-dimensional volumes and used to register the CT and PET studies in three dimensions using a sum of least squares fitting approach. The registered PET study was then displayed in a hot metal scale overlayed on top of the gray scale CT study. The accuracy of the fit was evaluated through a phantom study and preliminary clinical evaluation. RESULTS: A phantom study was performed to determine the limits of this technique. The accuracy was determined to be less than 2.3 mm in the x and y direction and 3 mm in the z direction. Preliminary clinical evaluation was also performed with encouraging results. CONCLUSION: This technique accurately registers PET and CT images of the thorax, retrospectively, without the need for external fiducial markers or other a priori action.
