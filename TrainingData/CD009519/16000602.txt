Clinical issues in the management of early lung cancer.
Lung cancer is commonly diagnosed after metastatic spread, when therapies are rarely curative, providing an impetus for continued research directed at exploring approaches for cost-effective early lung cancer detection. Recently published pilot studies across three continents support a benefit of spiral computed tomography (CT) in detecting earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer. Improved resolution of early lung cancer is a result of significant changes in CT imaging hardware and software. The status and implications of these developments are reviewed. Many aspects of the management of screening for early lung cancer could be informed by optimizing the downstream clinical management of potential lung cancers identified by CT screening. The first and most critical issue is whether or not this improved detection rate is clearly associated with a reduction in lung cancer-related mortality. However, other related issues such as cost-benefit evaluations are also considered. If smaller, truly localized primary cancer can be routinely detected, then options for less morbid interventions would also be desirable. The rapid improvement in resolution and cost of spiral CT has provided a powerful impetus to reconsider the possibilities for achieving safe, economical, and meaningful early lung cancer detection.
