Primary malignant bone neoplasm: a case report of dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma in the rib and review of the literature.
Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (DDCS) is a rare but highly malignant primary bone neoplasm, which is resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There remains uncertainly as to the best treatment of this disease and how to improve its prognosis. In this paper we reported a case of DDCS and reviewed the related literatures in order to provide references to throw a light on the histogenesis, diagnosis and therapy of this disease.
