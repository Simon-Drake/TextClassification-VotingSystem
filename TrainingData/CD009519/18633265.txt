[Combination chemotherapy composed of mFOLFOX 6, FOLFIRI 2 and surgery and radiation therapy for locoregional recurrences and multiple lung metastases from rectal cancer--a case report].
A 61-year-old man underwent amputation of the rectum for advanced lower rectal cancer in April 2005. UFT-E granules were administered orally daily at 400 mg/body/day following surgery. He developed perineal pain and perineal discharges following an increase the CEA level in April 2006. PET revealed a tumor in the perineum and multiple lung metastases. Chemotherapy with mFOLFOX 6 for 8 courses and FOLFIRI 2 for 4 courses were administered since July in 2006. Although CT revealed a the reduction in multiple lung metastases, CEA was increased to over a maximum 109, high fever continued and the pinealtumor was enlarged in December 2006. The patient underwent resection of the perinealmass, but he developed perinealsevere pain and perinealdischarge. So radiotherapy of the pelvic region was given at a total dose of 40 Gy(given 2 Gy each fragment)followed by administration of FOLFIRI 2 for 12 courses. After chemoradiotherapy, the CEA level was remarkably decreased. PET could not detect any mass in lung fields and revealed a little accumulation in the pelvic region. Chemotherapy with FOLFIRI 2 is administered monthly now, and the CEA level has been within the normal range since July of 2007. The pineal pain and pineal discharge disappeared, so the quality of life has improved dramatically.
