Follicular thyroid carcinoma with an eggshell calcification: report of 3 cases.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this series is to report 3 cases of follicular thyroid carcinoma with an eggshell calcification along with their imaging findings. METHODS: Imaging findings on gray scale and power Doppler (PD) sonography (n = 3), computed tomography (CT; n = 3), and integrated fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 ((18)F-FDG) whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/CT (n = 1) were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 3 cases, two 75-year-old women had bone metastasis, and one 54-year-old woman had a thyroid incidentaloma on sonography. All 3 cases had a spherical mass with an interrupted eggshell calcification on gray scale sonography and CT; 2 revealed intranodular vascularity on PD sonography, and 1 showed intense hypermetabolism (maximum standardized uptake value, 7.9 g/mL) on integrated (18)F-FDG whole-body PET/CT. CONCLUSIONS: Follicular carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a thyroid nodule with an eggshell calcification.
