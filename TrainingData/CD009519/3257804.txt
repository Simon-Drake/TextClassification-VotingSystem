[Emission computed tomography in the diagnosis of lung diseases].
Investigations of pulmonary perfusion with 99m Tc-MMA by the method of emission computed tomography (ECT) were conducted in 172 patients with different pulmonary diseases. The authors described ECT procedure of the lungs and scinti-tomographic symptomatology typical of the normal lungs and different types of pulmonary pathology (lung cancer, benign tumors, metastases and chronic inflammatory pulmonary processes). A high sensitivity of ECT as compared to poly-positional scintigraphy was shown. The obtained results suggested that ECT permitted more specified and earlier diagnosis of pulmonary perfusion disorders which was of great importance in the diagnosis of different pulmonary diseases as well as in the assessment of therapeutic efficacy.
