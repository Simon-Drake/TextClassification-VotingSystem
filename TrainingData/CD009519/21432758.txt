Primary pulmonary glomangioma: a coin lesion negative on PET study. Case report and literature review.
Glomus tumor is an uncommon perivascular lesion usually located in the dermis of the extremities. It rarely involves the respiratory tract or the lungs. We present the clinical and pathological features of a 39-year-old man who was evaluated for an incidental radiological finding of a pulmonary nodule. A chest computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of an upper left lobe coin lesion. Bronchoscopy and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were negative. An intraoperative frozen section examination was interpreted as a neuroendocrine tumor; therefore a left upper lobectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed. An immunohistochemical examination supported the diagnosis of a primary pulmonary glomangioma. The patient was free of disease at the 51-month follow-up. Due to its uncertain behavior we stress the usefulness of typical lung resection, lymph node dissection, and accurate follow-up.
