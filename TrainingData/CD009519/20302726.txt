[Positron emission tomography with special tracers in pulmonary abnormalities].
OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-choline (CH), (11)C-methionine (MET), (18)F-fluorothymidine (FLT), and (11)C-acetate (AC) in diagnosis of pulmonary abnormalities and the features of pulmonary abnormalities in PET. METHODS: From June 2002 to June 2007, 100 patients with pulmonary nodules or masses confirmed by CT scans received PET with special tracers. Fifty-eight patients received CH-PET, 16 patients received MET-PET, 22 patients received FLT-PET, 4 patients received AC-PET. PET data was analyzed by visual method and semiquantitative method with standard uptake value (SUV). Diagnoses were compared with pathology and follow-up survey. RESULTS: For identification of pulmonary neoplasms with CH-PET, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 84.2% (32/38), 57.9% (11/19) and 75.4% (43/57). In cancer cases, SUV had no correlation with tumor size or age. For identification of pulmonary neoplasms with MET-PET, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 6/7, 6/9 and 75.0% (12/16). In cancer cases, SUV had not correlation with tumor size or age. For identification of pulmonary neoplasms with FLT-PET, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 85.7% (12/14), 2/8 and 63.6% (14/22). In cancer cases, SUV had not correlation with tumor size or age. In AC-PET, only 1 case of pulmonary metastasis of kidney clear cell carcinoma showed acetate avid. Two squamous cell carcinoma and 1 adenocarcinoma didn't appear abnormal in AC-PET. CONCLUSION: CH, MET, FLT, AC are valuable in diagnosing but also lead to false positive and false negative.
