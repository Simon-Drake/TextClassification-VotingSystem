[Staging methods].
There have been main changes in the methods for the work-up of lung cancer over the last 15 years. Guidelines of the main scientific societies are reviewed. The new methods are discussed: brain nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), positron emission tomography (PET scan), mediastinal nodes biopsy by echoguided endoscopy. These new techniques will change the classical approach as recommended by ATS/ERS.
