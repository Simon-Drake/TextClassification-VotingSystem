Imaging the molecular signatures of apoptosis and injury with radiolabeled annexin V.
Annexin V is a ubiquitous intracellular protein in humans that has a variety of intriguing characteristics, including a nanomolar affinity for the membrane-bound constitutive anionic phospholipid known as phosphatidylserine (PS). PS is selectively expressed on the surface of apoptotic or physiologically stressed cells. As such, radiolabeled forms of annexin V have been used in both animal models and human Phase I and Phase II trials to determine if this tracer can be employed as an early surrogate marker of therapeutic efficacy in NSCLC and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Many other pulmonary imaging applications of radiolabeled annexin V are also possible, including the detection and monitoring of active pulmonary inflammation and other pathophysiologic stressors in a variety of diseases. In this article, the salient molecular features of apoptosis (and other forms of cell death) that permits imaging with radiolabeled annexin V will be discussed. The latest results from Phase II imaging trials with NSCLC and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will be also be detailed. Finally, the potential future application of this tracer for the imaging of other pulmonary pathologies will be outlined.
