Cancer screening using 18F-FDG PET/CT in Korean asymptomatic volunteers: a preliminary report.
OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to evaluate the clinical value of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for cancer screening in Korean asymptomatic people. METHODS: Between February 2004 and December 2006, 1,587 asymptomatic individuals underwent FDG PET/CT as part of a cancer screening program with some other diagnostic tests at the healthcare center of our hospital. After excluding patients with a history of malignant tumor, 1,336 subjects were enrolled. All PET/CT images were visually analyzed. In subjects showing positive findings for PET/CT or other screening tests, further diagnostic tests and pathological confirmation were performed. RESULTS: Of the 1,336 subjects, malignant tumors were found in 16 participants (1.2%, thyroid cancer: 9, lung cancer: 2, stomach cancer: 2, and others: 4). There were 47 cases (3.6%) of positive PET/CT findings--11 cases were true positive (thyroid cancer: 8, lung cancer: 1, renal cancer: 1, and invasive thymoma), and 36 false positive, and five cases were false negative. The overall detection rate of PET/CT was 0.8%, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value, and negative-predictive value of PET/CT were 68.8, 97.2, 23.4, and 99.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography has the potential to detect various kinds of malignant tumors in cancer screening test, and the overall detection rate of PET/CT was 0.8%. FDG PET/CT can be a useful cancer screening modality with the selection of high-risk group and appropriate combination with other screening modalities.
