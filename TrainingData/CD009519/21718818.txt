Surgical resection of locally advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma after gefitinib therapy.
First-line therapy with gefitinib prolongs progression-free survival and improves quality of life among selected patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Selected locally advanced patients may derive benefit from surgical resection after gefitinib therapy. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate the role of gefitinib therapy followed by surgical resection.
