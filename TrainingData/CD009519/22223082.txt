Multiple pulmonary nodules in ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome: cause or result?
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis mimicking lung cancer with lung to lung metastases in ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome (EAS). CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 60-year-old man suffering from hypokalemic alkalosis, hypertension and limbs paralysis was referred to our hospital. EAS caused by malignancy of lung was highly suspected due to multiple pulmonary nodules presenting on chest film and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Video-assisted thoracic surgical biopsy tissue was used to confirm invasive aspergillosis instead of malignancy. Finally, the patient died of opportunistic infection. CONCLUSION: This case showed that although EAS is usually associated with solid tumors, multiple pulmonary nodules secondary to opportunistic infections such as invasive aspergillosis must be kept in mind.
