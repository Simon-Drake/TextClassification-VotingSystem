Dual-mode optical projection tomography microscope using gold nanorods and hematoxylin-stained cancer cells.
An optical projection tomography microscope (OPTM) can improve axial resolution by viewing a sample from different perspectives. Here, we report a dual-mode OPTM that can generate 3D images of single cancer cells in both absorption mode and polarization mode. Cancer cells were labeled with hematoxylin for absorption imaging and nanorods for polarization imaging. Absorption images can provide morphologic information, and polarization images can provide molecular information. The combination of molecular detection and 3D cytological cell analysis may help with early cancer diagnosis.
