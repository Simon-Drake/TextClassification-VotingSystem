Functional imaging of physiological processes by positron emission tomography.
Tracer technology makes it possible to observe physiological and biochemical processes in the living organism in a dynamic mode. Positron emission tomography adds the use of chemically unchanged biomolecules and of quantification. This opens up fascinating possibilities for both fundamental research and routine diagnostic applications.
