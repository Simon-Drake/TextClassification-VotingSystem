[Staging of non-small cell lung cancer using CT and integrated PET-CT].
INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in developed countries. Radiological imaging methods are the basic methods in early diagnosis of this disease. TNM classification is a very important tool for optimal treatment in non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). Conventional radiological techniques allow the evaluation of the stage on the basis of anatomical changes only, while PET-CT provides information about the biochemical processes that may precede anatomical changes. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy and sensitivity of CT and PET-CT in the staging of NSCLC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted on a group of 99 patients with NSCLC diagnosed at the Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases in the period from January 2008 to May 2010. CT and PET-CT were performed in all patients. Histological or cytological examination of the material obtained from biopsy, bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and intraoperatively was the reference test. TNM classification was performed independently after CT and PET-CT. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: It has been shown that PET-CT is a more accurate and sensitive method than CT in the staging process in NSCLC. PET-CT allowed the correct classification of the T, N, M, and total TNM in, respectively, 97%, 95%, 99%, and 89% of cases, while for CT it was, respectively, 95%, 84%, 84%, and 68% (p = 0.0002).
