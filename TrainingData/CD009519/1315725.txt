Uptake of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-[U-14C]-glucose during chemotherapy in murine Lewis lung tumor.
Mice bearing intramuscular Lewis lung tumor were treated with BCNU and doxorubicin (ADM) to study chemotherapy-induced changes in the uptake of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-[U-14C]glucose (FDG). A decreased FDG uptake, tumor regression and a diminished proportion of aneuploid versus diploid cells as evaluated by DNA flow cytometry were seen after treatment with BCNU but not with ADM; HPLC indicated that most of the 14C activity in tumors was from FDG6-phosphate. The results suggest that changes in FDG uptake reflect the effectiveness of antitumor therapy. FDG may be valuable in follow-up studies of cancer treatment.
