[A case of a pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma with fever which responded well to chemotherapy].
BACKGROUND: Pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma is a very rare pulmonary malignant tumor which has various clinical manifestations and a poor prognosis. CASE: A 74-year-old man presented with fever and weight loss of more than 10kg during 2 months from April 200X. Chest CT showed a nodule in the right upper lobe, and supraclavicular and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Positron emission tomography (PET) comfirmed 18Ffluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the sites. A left supraclavicular node biopsy demonstrated pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma. The tumors responded well to gemcitabine plus docetaxel combination chemotherapy. This symptoms disappeared and the response continued for 1 year after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: We report a case of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma presenting with fever, which showed a marked response to chemotherapy.
