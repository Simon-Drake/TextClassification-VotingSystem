[Imaging and PET/CT of lung cancer].
Lung cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancer in the world. Imaging plays a critical role for screening, diagnosing, staging, and following patients. Although morphologic imaging such as chest X-ray and CT are still useful for these purpose, major limitations occur in the proper evaluation of diagnosing and staging. Metabolic imaging using PET significantly increases the accuracy of staging. This paper will review the role of imaging in patients suspected or diagnosed with lung cancer.
