Lung metastases treated with image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy.
AIMS: To evaluate outcomes after treatment with image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) using daily online cone beam computed tomography for malignancies metastatic to the lung. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven lung metastases in 32 patients were treated with volumetrically guided SBRT. The median age was 62 years (21-87). Primaries included colorectal (n = 10), sarcoma (n = 4), head and neck (n = 4), melanoma (n = 3), bladder (n = 2), non-small cell lung cancer (n = 2), renal cell (n = 2), thymoma (n = 2), thyroid (n = 1), endometrial (n = 1) and oesophageal (n = 1). The number of lung metastases per patient ranged from one to three (68% single lesions). SBRT was prescribed to the edge of the target volume to a median dose of 60 Gy (48-65 Gy) in a median of four fractions (four to 10). Most lesions were treated using 12 Gy fractions (92%) to 48 or 60 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 27.6 months (7.6-57.1 months). The 1, 2 and 3 year actuarial local control rates for all treated lesions were 97, 92 and 85%, respectively. Two patients with colorectal primaries (four lesions in total) had local failure. The median overall survival was 40 months. The 1, 2 and 3 year overall survival from the time of SBRT completion was 83, 76 and 63%, respectively. There were no grade 4 or 5 toxicities. Grade 3 toxicities (one instance of each) included pneumonitis, dyspnoea, cough, rib fracture and pain. CONCLUSION: SBRT with daily online cone beam computed tomography for lung metastases achieved excellent local tumour control with low toxicity and encouraging 2 and 3 year survival.
