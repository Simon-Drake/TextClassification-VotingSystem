Focal parenchymal lung lesions showing a potential of false-positive and false-negative interpretations on integrated PET/CT.
OBJECTIVE: We describe a number of benign focal lung lesions with increased 18F-FDG uptake that simulate lung cancer and malignant lesions that lead to false-negatives due to little 18F-FDG uptake on integrated PET/CT images. CONCLUSION: The integration of clinical history, morphologic findings of lung parenchymal lesions on the CT component, and metabolic activities on the PET component of integrated PET/CT can help reduce false interpretation of the study. A lung biopsy may be needed for lesions showing increased 18F-FDG uptake on PET for tissue confirmation irrespective of their morphology on CT.
