A novel approach to positron emission tomography in lung cancer.
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography is integral to the staging of lung cancer. We describe the combined use of diagnostic preoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography, intraoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose handheld gamma probe detection, and immediate postoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography patient and specimen imaging for improved staging and determination of adequacy of mediastinal lymph node dissection.
