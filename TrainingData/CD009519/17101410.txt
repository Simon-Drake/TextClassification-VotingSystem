Radiology-pathology conference: sclerosing hemangioma of the lung.
Sclerosing hemangioma (SH) is a relatively rare, benign neoplasm of the lung. Although there are relatively characteristic imaging findings, biopsy remains the definitive diagnostic test. We report the radiology and pathology of a patient with a SH, with emphasis on the computed tomographic and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography findings, and review the literature on this unusual tumor.
