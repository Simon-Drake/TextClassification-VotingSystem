Lung lobectomy in a patient with an implantable left ventricular assist device.
Non-cardiac surgical procedures in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) pose a special challenge given the hemodynamic and hematologic considerations in these patients. During pulmonary procedures in patients with LVADs, special attention should be paid to hemodynamics because lung resection surgery requires a lateral decubitus position, single-lung ventilation and postoperative decrease in the pulmonary vascular bed, all of which may lead to inadequate preload to the LVAD. We present a case of lower lobectomy of the left lung for an adenocarcinoma found in a patient with an implantable continuous-flow LVAD.
