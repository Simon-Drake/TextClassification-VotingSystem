Surveillance low-dose chest computed tomography for head and neck cancer patients.
Based on the recent results of the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network now recommends annual screening with low-dose computed tomography for high-risk individuals (generally defined as 45- to 60-year-old current or former smokers). As head and neck cancer patients are at a high risk for (second) lung cancers, annual surveillance computed tomography should be considered for head and neck cancer patients.
