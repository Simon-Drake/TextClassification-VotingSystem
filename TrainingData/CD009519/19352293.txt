F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT findings in active hiccups.
A 62-year-old man with nonsmall cell lung cancer presented for a staging F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography. Preimaging assessment determined that the patient had a 2-week history of persistent hiccups. The hiccups were unmanageable and persisted throughout the examination from FDG injection to imaging. Persistent hiccups can be seen in patients with advanced cancer. Characteristic findings on FDG positron emission tomography and computed tomographyare presented here.
