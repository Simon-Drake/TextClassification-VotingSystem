Pulmonary blastomycosis masquerading as metastatic disease in the lung: a case report.
We report a case of pulmonary blastomycosis appearing as metastatic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Pulmonary blastomycosis was discovered as right lower lobe subpleural activity consistent with metastatic disease on a positron emission tomographic (PET) scan following total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection for locally invasive laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest showed a right lower lobe, subpleural pulmonary nodule. CT-guided fine-needle aspiration of the nodule revealed broad-based budding yeast consistent with blastomycosis. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a PET-positive pulmonary blastomycosis lesion mimicking pulmonary malignancy reported in the literature.
