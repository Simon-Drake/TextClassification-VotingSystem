Synthesis of carbon-11-labeled 4-aryl-4H-chromens as new PET agents for imaging of apoptosis in cancer.
Carbon-11-labeled 4-aryl-4H-chromenes, 2-amino-7-(dimethylamino)-4-(3-[(11)C]methoxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-4H-chromene-3-carb onitrile ([(11)C]6a), 2-amino-4-(3-bromo-4-[(11)C]methoxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-7-(dimethylamino)-4H-chromen e-3-carbonitrile ([(11)C]6c), 2-amino-4-(3-[(11)C]methoxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-4,7-dihydropyrano[2,3-e]indole-3-car bonitrile ([(11)C]6d), 2-amino-4-(3-bromo-4-[(11)C]methoxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-4,7-dihydropyrano[2,3-e]indo le-3-carbonitrile ([(11)C]6f), 2-amino-4-(3-[(11)C]methoxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-4,9-dihydropyrano[3,2-g]indole-3-car bonitrile ([(11)C]6g), 2-amino-4-(3-bromo-4-[(11)C]methoxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-4,9-dihydropyrano[3,2-g]indo le-3-carbonitrile ([(11)C]6i), 2-amino-4-(3-[(11)C]methoxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-7-methyl-4,7-dihydropyrano[2,3-e]ind ole-3-carbonitrile ([(11)C]6j) and 2-amino-4-(3-bromo-4-[(11)C]methoxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-7-methyl-4,7-dihydropyrano[2 ,3-e]indole-3-carbonitrile ([(11)C]6l), were prepared by O-[(11)C]methylation of their corresponding precursors using [(11)C]CH(3)OTf under basic conditions and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) method in 30-50% radiochemical yields based on [(11)C]CO(2) and decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB). The overall synthesis time from EOB was 15-20min, the radiochemical purity was >99%, and the specific activity at end of synthesis (EOS) was 111-185GBq/micromol.
