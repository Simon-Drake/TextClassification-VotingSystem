99mTc tetrofosmin uptake in lung cancer. A case report.
This case report describes a 71-year-old man with a lung tumor in the posterior inferior segment of the right lung, detected on a screening chest radiograph. The patient underwent myocardial imaging with 99mTc tetrofosmin and 201Tl, using single photon emission CT (SPECT), and the tumor showed intense focal uptake of the radiotracer. This observation supports the recent suggestion that 99mTc tetrofosmin may be useful for oncologic imaging of lung carcinoma, and further studies may be warranted.
