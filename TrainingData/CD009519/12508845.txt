Comparison of [18F]FDG-PET and L-3[123I]-iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine (I-123 IMT)-SPECT in primary lung cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate L-3[123I]-iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine (IMT)-SPECT and FDG-PET in pulmonary lesions suspected to be lung cancer. METHODS: Whole body PET (measured transmission corrected emission scans) was performed 45 minutes after i.v. injection of 222-370 MBq (6-10 mCi) 18F-FDG on a Siemens PET scanner (ECAT EXACT 47) including 5-6 bed positions. 123I-IMT-SPECT (chest) was performed after injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) with a dual head camera (Picker Prism 2000) and commercially available reconstruction algorithms. Ten patients (6 male and 4 female) with suspected lung cancer were investigated. The results were compared to histological findings after surgery or bronchoscopic biopsies and CT. RESULTS: 123I-IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET were able to detect all 9 cases of lung cancer (1-8 cm in diameter). One case was true negative. Both imaging methods were true positive with respect to mediastinal lymph node metastases in one patient. The tumor/background ratio was higher with PET (8.20 vs. 2.84). CONCLUSION: Despite the limited number of patients it may be concluded that IMT-SPECT as well as FDG-PET are suited to correctly diagnose lung cancer. Nevertheless, FDG-PET, if available, seems to be better suited because of the higher tumor/background ratio and better resolution.
