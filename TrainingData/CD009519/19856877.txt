[PET-CT in evaluation of pulmonary nodule--case report].
A 52-year-old woman underwent a left nephrectomy for clear cell type renal carcinoma. One year after, chest computed tomography revealed the presence of small nodule (7 mm) in 9th segment of right lung. Radiological examination not make possible to determine a character of the nodule. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography in patient no demonstrated increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake typical for malignant tumors. Diagnosis of the small peripheral nodules in the lung is very difficult. The most important specificity and sensitivity to distinguish benign from malignant was described for PET-CT. It is first paper in Poland about use of the PET-CT in differential diagnosis small nodules in lung.
