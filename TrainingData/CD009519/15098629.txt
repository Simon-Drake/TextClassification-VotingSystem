The role of FDG-PET in the management of non-small cell lung carcinoma.
INTRODUCTION: Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-2-fluoro-2 deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has been widely investigated and used in the non-invasive imaging of malignancy. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is one of the most common and best validated indications for an FDG-PET scan. This review examines the roles of FDG-PET in the management of NSCLC and attempts to identify emerging uses and possible future developments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature review of English language literature indexed on Medline. RESULTS: There is strong evidence to support the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of FDG-PET in the characterisation of solitary pulmonary nodules and in the staging of NSCLC. In addition, there are emerging uses in radiotherapy planning, monitoring of treatment response and prognostication. CONCLUSIONS: FDG-PET plays an integral role in the management of NSCLC and it is likely to expand as evidence supporting additional roles in the management of NSCLC becomes available.
