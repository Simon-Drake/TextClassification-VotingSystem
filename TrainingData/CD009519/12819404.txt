Oral administration of F-18 FDG to evaluate a single pulmonary nodule by positron emission tomography in a patient with poor intravenous access.
F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is typically administered intravenously for positron emission tomography. The authors present a case of oral administration of FDG for evaluation of a pulmonary nodule and review the limited literature on this subject. Oral administration of FDG is a useful alternative to intravenous administration in patients with difficult intravenous access when the alimentary tract is not involved in the clinical diagnosis.
