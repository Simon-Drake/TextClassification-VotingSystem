[Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma LELC of the lung].
A 77-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with abnormal chest shadow detected on a medical checkup. Chest computed tomography(CT)showed a well-defined tumor in the upper lobe of the right lung. On positron emission tomography by fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG),the tumor revealed to be positive. We performed right upper lobectomy with hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection. The histopathological diagnosis was lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC). In the past 25-years, 41 cases have been reported in Japan. The average age is 64 years old, including 25 male cases and 16 female cases. Among these cases, more than half were in the early resectable stage.
