[Bifocal lung cancer: the same histology?].
Whereas synchronous lung cancer is rare, synchronous small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are exceptional. The authors report the case of a 61-year-old man with synchronous unilateral adenocarcinoma and small cell lung cancer, raising the question as to the need for the histology of all of the lesions in the same lobe or same lung as well as the treatment. The medical history, biology, CT and (18)F-FDG TEP-CT did not support a diagnosis of synchronous lung cancer. The prognosis was poor and only surgery could improve the prognosis. This is a rare case and illustrates the difficulty in the diagnosis of multiple lung cancer and the difficulty in treating synchronous lung cancer with different histologies (SCLC and NSCLC).
