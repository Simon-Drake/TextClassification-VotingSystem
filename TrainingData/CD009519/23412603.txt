Primary rhabdomyosarcoma of pulmonary artery: 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting recurrence in a rare tumor.
Primary pulmonary artery rhabdomyosarcomas are very rare tumors with a small number of cases reported in the literature. Here we show (18)F-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) images of a 58-year-old man with left pulmonary artery rhabdomyosarcoma who had undergone surgery for the primary tumor followed by chemotherapy. Restaging FDG PET/CT showed local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis. This case highlights that FDG PET/CT can be useful for restaging rare tumors such as pulmonary artery rhabdomyosarcoma.
