Morules with biotin-containing optically clear nuclei in colonic tubular adenoma.
Morules have been reported in pulmonary endodermal tumors (PET) resembling fetal lung, in thyroid carcinoma, and in endometrial and colonic neoplasms. A morule has biotin-containing optically clear nuclei (OCN) in PET and thyroid carcinoma. Biotin-containing OCN have been also reported in endometrial tissue during pregnancy and in endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary, and it has been postulated that morules or OCN develop under the influence of female sex hormones. The authors report here the first case, to their knowledge, of morules with OCN in a colonic adenoma from a 68-year-old man. The colonic polyp consisted of ordinary tubular adenomatous tissue and morules. Many cells in the morules contained OCN. The OCN were immunopositive for biotin and reacted with streptavidin. The neoplastic cells in the morules were immunopositive for oncofetal antigens. Serum levels of female sex hormones were within the normal range, and no cells in the adenoma were immunopositive for receptors for progesterone and estrogen. The results indicate that OCN are rich in biotin and that morules may be embryologically immature elements that develop independently of influence by female sex hormones.
