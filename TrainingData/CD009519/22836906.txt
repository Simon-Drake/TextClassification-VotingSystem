Lung-cancer related chest events detected by periodical follow-up CT after stereotactic body radiotherapy for stage I primary lung cancer: retrospective analysis of incidence of lung-cancer related chest events and outcomes of salvage treatment.
PURPOSE: Follow-up by chest CT is often performed routinely after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary lung cancer. We investigated how often periodical chest CT detected lung-cancer related chest events (failure in the chest, new primary lung cancer), and how often chest CT follow-ups led to curative intent salvage treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2009, 90 stage I primary lung cancers in 86 patients received SBRT. In principle, chest CT was scheduled every 2-3 months in the first two years, and every 3-4 months thereafter. RESULTS: Median time to follow-up by chest CT was 26 months (1-61 months). Twenty-seven lung-cancer related chest events were detected by periodical chest CT after SBRT. The three-year lung-cancer related chest event free rate was 62 %. It was possible to apply curative-intent salvage treatment to 56 % of the lung-cancer related chest events. The two-year overall survival rate was 66 % among the 13 patients who received curative-intent salvage treatment (radiotherapy, 11; surgery, 2). CONCLUSION: Post-SBRT lung-cancer related chest events (as detected by periodical chest CT) were not uncommon (approximately 40 % at 3 years from SBRT), and it was possible to treat more than half of these lesions with curative-intent salvage treatment.
