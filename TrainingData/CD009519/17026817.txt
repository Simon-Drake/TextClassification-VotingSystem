A multidisciplinary approach to management in a patient with bilateral superior sulcus non-small-cell lung carcinoma.
Superior sulcus tumors comprise a rare subset of non-small-cell lung carcinomas that are particularly challenging to treat because of their location and extent of nerve and vessel involvement. In this report, we present a case illustrating the uncommon situation of a patient presenting with bilateral superior sulcus tumors, and we review the latest combined therapeutic approach developed to aggressively treat the more common unilateral presentation of these tumors.
