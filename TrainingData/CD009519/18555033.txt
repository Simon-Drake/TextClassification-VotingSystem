The value of dual time point (18)F-FDG PET imaging for the differentiation between malignant and benign lesions.
AIM: To assess the clinical value of dual time point 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) imaging for the differentiation between malignant and benign lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients (28 patients with primary lung cancer, 18 patients with digestive system carcinoma, 13 patients with other malignant tumours, and 37 patients with benign lesions) underwent FDG-PET/CT at two time points: examination 1 at 45-55 min and examination 2 at 160+/-24 (150-180) min after the intravenous injection of 233+/-52 (185-370)MBq (18)F-FDG. Reconstructed images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. The maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the lesions were calculated for both time points. An increase was considered to have occurred if the SUVs at examination 2 had increased by >10% as compared with those at the examination 1. RESULTS: The lesions in 24 of 28 (86%) patients with primary lung cancer had an SUVmax > or = 2.5 at examination 1. Of these, SUVmax values increased in 23 patients, but had not changed in one patient, at examination 2. The lesions in the other four patients with primary lung tumour had SUVmax values between 1.5 and 2.5 at examination 1, which were considered as suspected positive, increased SUVmax values were observed in three of these patients at examination 2. The malignant lesions in 17 of 18 patients with digestive system carcinoma showed SUVmax values > or = 2.5 and only one patient had an SUVmax value < 1.5 at examination 1; all lesions showed an increase in SUVmax values at examination 2. In 13 patients with other malignant tumours, all lesions had SUVmax values > or = 2.5 at examination 1 and the SUVmax values were further increased at examination 2. Therefore, the malignant lesions in 54/59 (92%) of patients had SUVmax values > or = 2.5 at examination 1 and showed a further increase in SUVmax value at examination 2. Only 12 of 37 (32%) patients with benign lesions showed SUVmax values > or = 2.5 at examination 1 and nine patients with benign lesions had SUVmax values > or = 2.5 in examination 2. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values for the early and delayed imaging were 91.5, 67.6, 82.3, 81.8, and 83.3%, and 98.3, 75.7, 89.6, 86.6, and 96.6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study provide further evidence that dual time point (18)F-FDG PET imaging is an important noninvasive method for the differentiation of malignant and nonmalignant lesions.
