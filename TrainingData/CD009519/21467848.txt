F-18 FDG PET/CT in evaluation of pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma.
PURPOSE: Pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma (PSH), or the alternative name of "sclerosing pneumocytoma," is a rare benign neoplasm. PSH is often asymptomatic and presents as a solitary pulmonary nodule on radiologic imaging studies. Few articles have been reported to describe the FDG PET findings about PSH. We reported FDG PET findings of 6 cases of PSH and reviewed the literatures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FDG PET and PET/CT imaging studies of 6 patients with proven PSH were reviewed. The relation between the degree of FDG uptake and tumor size was analyzed. RESULTS: All 6 tumors were detected by FDG PET or PET/CT. Mean diameter of these tumors was 2.9 cm. Mean standard uptake value was 2.45 (range, 1.8-3.93). The maximal standard uptake value of FDG uptake was positively correlated with the tumor size (R = 0.9694, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PSH demonstrates low to moderate uptake on FDG PET imaging. The larger PSH has higher uptake and might be misrecognized as a malignancy. The possibility of false-positive result caused by PSH should be considered while interpreting FDG PET images of solitary pulmonary nodules.
