[Clinical indications for PET in oncology].
Diagnostic success of PET in oncology is based on the frequently higher glucose metabolism of tumor tissue. This has been demonstrated for many tumor types in a sufficient number of patients. A clear indication for PET in oncology is the differentiation of residual tumor or tumor recurrence from fibrosis. PET furthermore permits to distinguish lymph node metastasis from other adenopathies irrespective of lymph node size. It is therefore of use in those situations where tumor stage is influencing therapeutic decisions i.e. when operability of a malignancy is in question. Studies on the validity of PET investigations have been conducted in colorectal, pulmonary, hepatic, musculoskeletal and urologic malignant lymphoma. Prior to chemo- or hormonotherapy the uptake of the chemotherapeutic agent (5-fluorouracil) or the presence of hormone receptors (estrogen receptors) can be measured. This permits to optimize therapies by minimizing adverse effects and to limit treatment by those promising success. The therapeutic success can be monitored and possible development of resistance of tumors or part of a tumor can be detected.
