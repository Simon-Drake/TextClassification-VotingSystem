A case of lung cancer associated with pneumoconiosis diagnosed by fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.
We report a case of lung cancer arising from progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) associated with pneumoconiosis. In this case, fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was able to clearly distinguish the lung cancer from PMF, suggesting a potential usefulness of FDG-PET in cancer screening in patients with pneumoconiosis. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an FDG-PET image of lung cancer arising from PMF.
