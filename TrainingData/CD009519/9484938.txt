Pelvic girdle chondrosarcoma and inferior vena cava thrombosis.
Pelvic girdle chondrosarcomas in children and adolescents are extremely rare. These high grade malignant chondrosarcomas with a locally aggressive growth pattern have a high tendency for thrombus formations in the afferent tumour vessels, associated with an increased risk of inferior vena cava thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and metastatic spread to the lungs. This tumour location is generally non-resectable for cure and, since adjuvant chemotherapy is ineffective, patients die from the tumour thrombus formation causing tumour emboli and metastatic disease to the lungs. Effective local tumour control can be achieved with high-dose hyperfractionated radiation therapy.
