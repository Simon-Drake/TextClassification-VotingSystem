FDG-PET findings in sclerosing hemangioma of the lung: a case report.
We report a case of sclerosing hemangioma of the lung that showed an intermediately increased accumulation of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET). We suggest that FDG-PET may be useful for considering a lesion as benign or low-grade malignant.
