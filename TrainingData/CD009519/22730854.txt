Population characterization, histological evaluation, and timeliness of care of surgical nonsmall cell lung cancer patients in a military academic medical center.
UNLABELLED: Lung cancer remains a major medical impediment in which early diagnosis and timely treatment are key factors in its management. This study evaluated nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in a large military medical center to determine the timeliness to diagnosis and curative surgery in comparison with published guidelines. A retrospective record review of tumor registry NSCLC surgery cases at Navy Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) from 2004 to 2009 was conducted. Of the 84 patients, 49% were women, the median age was 63, 58% were Caucasian, and 71% represented ex- or active smokers. A significant number of women were Asian (30%) and nonsmokers (77%). The predominant histology was adenocarcinoma (86%) with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) nonavid (57%). Median time for pulmonologist evaluation was 8 days, median time for PET-CT was 13 days, median time for cardiothoracic surgery evaluation to thoracotomy was 25 days, and median time from pulmonologist evaluation to thoractomy was 59 days. CONCLUSIONS: Except for the pulmonary specialist referral time (8 vs. 7 days), timeliness of diagnosis and curative surgery for NSCLC patients at NMCSD was within international guideline recommendations. Additional proposals have been made to improve the evaluation and treatment of lung cancer patients.
