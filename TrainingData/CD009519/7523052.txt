[The value of Sm-153-EDTMP for treatment of metastatic bone pain and improving quality of life].
Sm-153-EDTMP (ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonic acid), a beta-particle and gamma-emitting radionuclide, was used for pain control of bone metastasis. Fourty patients with bone metastasis were administrated a single intravenous injection of 29.6 MBq/kg (0.8mCi/kg), and 7 of them received more than one injection. No obvious side effect was observed. The skeletal images obtained with Sm-153-EDTMP were similar to that of Tc-99m-MDP SPECT images. Follow up study (at least 30 days) revealed bone pain relief and improved quality of life in 82.5% of the treated patients.
