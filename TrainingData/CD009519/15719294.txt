[Detection of airways stenoses: comparison of virtual and flexible bronchoscopy].
PURPOSE: To compare virtual with flexible bronchoscopy for the detection of bronchial stenoses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study, we compared the results of 26 patients, who had clinical suspected pathologies of the tracheobronchial airways and underwent both flexible bronchoscopy and multislice CT with 3D surface rendering of the airways. Flexible bronchoscopy and virtual bronchoscopy were compared as to the rate of detecting bronchial stenoses. For statistical analysis, we divided the tracheobronchial tree in the following sections: trachea, 2 main bronchi, 6 lobar bronchi, 18 segmental bronchi and 36 subsegmental bronchi, corresponding to 63 bronchial sections for each patient (on average) and a total of 1638 bronchial sections for all 26 patients. We graded the bronchial stenosis as less than 50 %, as 50 to 95 % and as complete obstruction. RESULTS: Virtual bronchoscopy detected 25 bronchial stenoses, while flexible bronchoscopy only revealed 17 stenoses. Stenoses with a diameter less than 50 % were found with virtual bronchoscopy 14 times and with flexible bronchoscopy 10 times. Stenoses with a diameter between 50 and 95 % were detected 7 and 4 times, respectively, and complete obstructions 4 and 3 times, respectively. Tracheobronchial stenoses were well recognized with virtual bronchoscopy. Moreover, the virtual method enabled the visualization of high-grade stenoses and post-stenotic areas that could not be passed by the fiberoptic bronchoscope. Virtual bronchoscopy detected stenoses at a higher rate but the difference was not statistically significant (stenoses < 50 %: p = 0.352, 50 - 95 %: p = 0.339, complete obstruction: p = 0.696). CONCLUSION: Virtual bronchoscopy is a useful non-invasive method for the diagnostic evaluation of the tracheobronchial tree. In comparison with flexible bronchoscopy, virtual bronchoscopy is superior in revealing high-grade stenoses and visualizing post-stenotic areas.
