Usefulness of F-18 FDG PET/CT as one-stop-shop imaging modality for diagnosis of occult primary and estimation of disease burden in patients with intraocular masses.
Metastases are the most common intraocular malignancy. Determination of the primary site and entire burden of disease as a part of initial staging is important in choosing the most appropriate management strategy. F-18 FDG PET/CT can demonstrate primary neoplasms and the whole-body total burden of disease. We present 2 cases of intraocular metastases from lung carcinoma where F-18 FDG PET/CT was useful as one-stop-shop imaging modality in detection of the primary and in assessment of total disease burden.
