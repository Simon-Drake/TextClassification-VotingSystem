Application of advanced imaging modalities for the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lungs in the temporomandibular joint.
Several pathologies, including malignant diseases, may mimic temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Correct diagnosis is important to avoid treatment delay. Several new imaging diagnostic modalities are available and should be used accordingly. This is a case report of a 71-year-old woman with functional limitation and painful symptoms in the preauricular region. She was initially diagnosed and treated as TMD, however with no improvement of the symptoms. Advanced imaging studies were requested. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings were consistent with soft tissue tumor with nonhomogeneous content in the left temporomandibular joint region. Positron emission tomography showed significant radiotracer uptake in the site of the lesion as well as in the lungs, lumbar spine, and bladder, suggesting tumoral metastases. This report emphasizes the importance of imaging in the assessment and establishment of accurate differential diagnosis. Thorough knowledge of the available modalities and their indications is essential to avoid delay in treatment and improve outcomes.
