Mycobacterium avium intracellulare infection coexistent with nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma involving the lung.
A 5.5-year-old asymptomatic Hispanic/African American male presented with matted lymph nodes in the neck and reticulonodular opacities in the right upper lung. An extensive diagnostic work up was performed to rule out infectious etiologies. Biopsies of the lymph node and lung tissue were diagnostic of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. Two weeks into the chemotherapy, gastric aspirates grew Mycobacterium avium intracellulare. This is the first case of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma involving the lung with coexistent Mycobacterium avium intracellulare.
