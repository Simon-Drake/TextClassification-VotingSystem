[Thoracic SPECT using (111 In-DTPA-D-Phe1)-octreotide in bronchial carcinoid syndrome].
We describe two cases of bronchial carcinoid tumour detected by (111In-DTPA-D-Phe1)-octreotide scintigraphy. The SPECT of the thoratic region provided a better images of the primary tumour than the planar images. In one of the patients, the bronchial carcinoid tumour was associated with sarcoidosis, which led to an erroneous evaluation of the extension of the tumour.
