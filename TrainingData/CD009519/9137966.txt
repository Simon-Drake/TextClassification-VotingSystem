Imaging and medical staging of lung cancer.
Chest radiography and CT scanning remain the backbone of imaging of lung cancer, and they continue to play a pivotal role in staging. This role is best defined as providing a roadmap to oncologists and surgeons to assist in definitive pathologic staging, rather than as competing with these methods. Much more sensitive and specific imaging tools must be developed before noninvasive radiologic staging can replace surgical staging. New nuclear medicine techniques including PET scanning and use of monoclonal antibodies linked to radionuclides offer the best hope for such definitive radiologic staging in the future.
