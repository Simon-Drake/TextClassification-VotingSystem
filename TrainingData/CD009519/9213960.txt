[Electrical impedance tomography in pulmonology].
Application of a modern method of introscopy--electroimpedance tomography (EIT) for diagnosis of different types of lung diseases is described. The EIT system including measurement and collecting data devices, 16-electrodes array and IBM PC 486 computer was used. The results of analysis of electrotomograms have demonstrated that the EIT-system can be introduced for detecting abnormal lung fluid levels, pulmonary edema, diagnosis of lung cancer, emphysema, pleuritis, hydrothorax, sarcoidosis. The method provides high sensitivity to the changes in the body physiological state. Other advantages are: safety, fast measurements, ease of equipment transportation and maintenance, low cost.
