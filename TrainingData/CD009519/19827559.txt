[Lung cancer detected by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the course of Mycobacterium avium infection; report of a case].
The patient was 64-year-old male. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an 18 mm of nodular lesion in the right upper lobe, in which inflammatory lesions due to the Mycobacterium avium infection was preexisted. On fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan, value of standard uptake value (SUV) max was 4.0. This finding may be caused by the inflammatory change but the malignancy was more likely with a concomitant finding of elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Surgical resection by right upper lobectomy was performed. Postoperative pathology confirmed the existence of adenocarcinoma in the lesions of epithelioid granuloma with giant cells. FDG-PET/CT contributed effectively to detect a malignancy in the inflammatory lesions of Mycobacterium avium infection.
