Initial experience with Tc-99m-HM-PAO in the study of brain tumors.
A preliminary study of the distribution of the 99mTc complex of hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HM-PAO) in 12 patients with brain neoplasms before, during, and after radiotherapy has been performed. Untreated brain tumors were found to exhibit a range of 99mTc-HM-PAO uptake, varying from areas of markedly increased isotope activity to photopenic areas, when compared to normal brain tissue. A ratio of 99mTc-HM-PAO tumor uptake to contralateral normal tissue uptake was calculated prior to and during radiotherapy. This ratio tended to return towards unity in lesions responding to therapy. A predictable alteration in whole brain 99mTc-HM-PAO uptake during radiotherapy was not demonstrated. Unlike the radiolabeled amines, 99mTc-HM-PAO localizes in primary tumors, probably indicating that its uptake mechanism is independent of non specific amine receptors. 99mTc-HM-PAO may be useful in the study of brain tumor physiology and response to therapy.
