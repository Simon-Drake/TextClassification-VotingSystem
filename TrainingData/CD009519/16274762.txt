The incorporation of SPECT functional lung imaging into inverse radiotherapy planning for non-small cell lung cancer.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often have inhomogeneous lung perfusion. Radiotherapy planning computed tomography (CT) scans have been accurately co-registered with lung perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans to design radiotherapy treatments which limit dose to healthy 'perfused' lung. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with localised NSCLC had CT and SPECT scans accurately co-registered in the planning system. The SPECT images were used to define a volume of perfused 'functioning' lung (FL). Inverse planning software was used to create 3D-conformal plans, the planning objective being either to minimise the dose to whole lungs (WL) or to minimise the dose to FL. RESULTS: Four plans were created for each of six patients. The mean difference in volume between WL and FL was 1011.7 cm(3) (range 596.2-1581.1cm(3)). One patient with bilateral upper lobe perfusion deficits had a 16% reduction in FLV(20) (the percentage volume of functioning lung receiving >or=20 Gy). The remaining patients had inhomogeneous perfusion deficits such that inverse planning was not able to sufficiently optimise beam angles to avoid functioning lung. CONCLUSION: SPECT perfusion images can be accurately co-registered with radiotherapy planning CT scans and may be helpful in creating treatment plans for patients with large perfusion deficits.
