Does gallium uptake in the pulmonary hila predict involvement by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
67Ga imaging of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is useful for evaluating the presence of viable tumour in a residual mass after treatment. However, we have frequently seen gallium uptake in the pulmonary hila without other evidence of lymphoma. To study the significance of this finding, 79 patients with intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were reviewed. Thirty-seven (47%) had abnormal hilar gallium uptake. Twenty-three of these could be fully evaluated, and only five (22%) had hilar lymphoma. A pattern of bilateral, symmetric hilar uptake was seen in 19 patients, but only one had evidence of lymphoma. In 15 cases, this pattern was seen only on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The aetiology of this uptake remains unknown. It is not treatment related, as 12 patients had hilar gallium uptake prior to chemotherapy. Unless confirmed by other methods, hilar gallium uptake should not be attributed to lymphoma, and should not influence patient management.
