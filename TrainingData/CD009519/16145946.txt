Lymphangitis carcinomatosa in thin section computed tomography.
High resolution computed tomography is a diagnostic method of choice in the evaluation of lung parenchyma. HRCT enables the evaluation of small interstitial changes, invisible on plain chest radiographs, and their assessment at the level of the lung lobule. The aim of the study was the assessment of typical findings in HRCT in lymphangitis carcinomatosa, enabling differential diagnosis. Material comprises a group of 18 patients with lymphangitic spread of carcinoma, in whom HRCT examination was performed. Nodular thickening of the peribronchovascular interstitium and interlobular septa are typical in lymphangitic spread of carcinoma. Smooth peribronchovascular and septal thickenings are typical in sarcoidosis, and are only seen in some patients in the lymphangitic spread of carcinoma. In lymphangitis carcinomatosa lung architecture remains unchanged, which allows differentiating from sarcoidosis.
