How can we further improve radiotherapy for stage-III non-small-cell lung cancer?
Combined modality treatment in advanced NSCLC has produced some gain in treatment outcome. Local control as addressed by radiotherapy is still a significant site of failure. Doses higher than achieved by conventional conformal radiotherapy are shown to result in better control rates. Volume restriction seems to be the most important issue in dose escalation. Integration of PET imaging into target definition, omission of clinically uninvolved lymph-node areas and measures to decrease set-up and movement uncertainties are explored. Introduction of risk estimation based on dose-volume analysis for dose prescription may further optimise individual treatment.
