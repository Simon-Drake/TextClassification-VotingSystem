Imaging of a metastatic gastrointestinal carcinoid by F-18-DOPA positron emission tomography.
The localization of carcinoids in the gastrointestinal tract is frequently difficult if not impossible with the imaging procedures used to date. It is reported on a patient with metastasizing carcinoid in whom various imaging procedures were not successful in detecting the primary tumor. Due to the importance of primary tumor proof for potential curative surgical therapy, a whole-body positron emission tomography with F-18-DOPA was performed. PET enabled localization of a potential primary tumor in the ileum. Moreover, in addition to the known abdominal lymph node and liver metastases, it detected a mediastinal lymph node metastasis and a pulmonary metastasis. F-18-DOPA whole-body PET may be a very promising imaging approach to the localization and staging of gastrointestinal carcinoids.
