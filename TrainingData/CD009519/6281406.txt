Brain tumor evaluation using Rb-82 and positron emission tomography.
Positron emission tomography of the brain with 75-sec rubidium-82 obtained from a portable generator (25-day Sr-82 leads to Rb-82) was used to evaluate the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in patients with brain tumors. Rubidium is normally excluded from the central nervous system by the intact BBB, but when the BBB is disrupted by a tumor. Rb enters and pools in the extravascular spaces of the central nervous system. Since Rb is also rapidly cleared from the blood, a high tissue-to-blood ratio of the Rb-82 tracer is achieved in regions of BBB disruption after intravenous injection. With dynamic positron emission tomographic imaging, the extravasation of the Rb tracer can be evaluated independent of the intravascular Rb concentration, and very small changes in the BBB permeability can be detected. The results of our studies in eight patients show that this technique is a promising method for evaluation of the BBB integrity in brain-tumor patients.U
