Complex partial status epilepticus in paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.
Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) results from tumor-related autoimmune mediated inflammation and degeneration of the mesial temporal structures. Cognitive and behavioral changes and seizures occur in PLE. Seizures are an uncommon presenting symptom of PLE occurring in 6 of 50 patients in one series. We present a report of complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE) as the presentation of PLE with anti-neuronal antibodies and improvement in mental status following treatment of seizures.
