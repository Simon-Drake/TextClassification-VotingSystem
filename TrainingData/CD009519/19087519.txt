[Clinical evaluation of autoantibody of splice variant of BARD1 in detection of ovarian cancer].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of autoantibody of breast cancer susceptibility 1-associated RING domain (BARD1) splice variant (OV-142) in detection of ovarian cancer. METHODS: We cloned OV-142 gene into plasmid pET-30b(+). The recombinant protein of OV-142 was expressed in pET-30b(+) system and purified. The autoantibody of OV-142 was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: We successfully constructed the recombinant plasmid of OV-142. The recombinant protein was expressed in pET-30b(+) system and purified. The purification rate of the recombinant protein was up to 90%. The relative amount of autoantibody of OV-142 detected by indirect ELISA was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the cutoff value was determined. Combination of the autoantibody IgG of OV-142 and CA(125) was analyzed by logistic regression. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was 71.4%, 89.1%, and 81.9%, respectively, which were higher than IgG (41.3%, 84.2%, 66.8%) and CA(125) (61.1%, 88.0%, 77.1%) when used alone each. CONCLUSIONS: OV-142 is a splice variant of BARD1. It may be a potential immunotherapy target of ovarian cancer. Detection of autoantibody of OV-142 is a potent complementary tool of CA(125) in ovarian cancer diagnosis.
