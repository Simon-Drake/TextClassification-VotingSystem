[Inhibition of proliferation, adhesion and invasion ability of human lung carcinoma cell A549 by tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE)].
We constructed prokaryotic expression vectors for different domains of TACE gene and expressed the fusion proteins, so as to explore their effects on the proliferation, adhesion and invasion potential of tumor cells in vitro. The total RNA was isolated from THP1 cell. TACE cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and subcloned into pMD18-T vector to construct pMD-18T-TACE vector. The different cDNA fragment of TACE were amplified from plasmid pMD-18T-TACE and then cloned into pET-28a( + ) to construct expression vector pET28a( + )- 300, pET28a( + )-T800, and pET28a( + )-T1300, which respectively transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). The expression of His-tagged fusion proteins were induced with IPTG and purified through BBST NTA resin. The proliferation ability was examined by MTT assay. The adhesive and invasive ability were examined by plated adhesion model and Transwell assay. The protein pET28a( + )-T300 and pET28a( + )-T1300 can reduce the proliferation, adhesion and invasion ability of human lung carcinoma cell A549 in vitro, but otherwise the protein pET28a( + )-T800 had not shown the inhibitive function. The fusion protein of disintegrin domain of TACE have the similar biological function to other disintegrins, which can be used for further research on function of TACE in inflammation and tumor.
