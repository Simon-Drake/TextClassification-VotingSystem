Endobronchial myxoma--case report.
INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary myxoma is an extremely rare benign neoplasm. It is mostly parenchymal but may occasionally occur within the tracheobronchial tree. There are very few reports of endobronchial myxoma. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of endobronchial myxoma in a 40-year-old female patient with a history of asthma and repeated right-sided pneumonia. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) showed medium lobe atelectasis. Fiber optic bronchoscopy revealed a polypoid, well-circumscribed tumor, causing total obstruction of the medium lobe bronchus. Biopsy of the mass was non-diagnostic. Further study included a positron emission tomography (PET) which demonstrated low metabolic activity of the tumor and no evidence of neoplasia in other location. The patient was submitted to a medium lobectomy and microscopic examination of the tumor revealed myxoid stroma with lobulated pattern, elongated and stellate cells, compatible with myxoma. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary myxoma is extraordinary rare and endobronchial location is very few reported in medical literature.
