One patient with metastastic colorectal cancer successfully treated by combination of targeted agents after failure of chemotherapy.
Either cetuximab or bevacizumab can improve the survival of patients with metastastic colorectal cancer (mCRC) if administered combided with cytotoxic agents. However, the effect of two or more target agents in combination is uncertain in these patients. Here, we reported a patient with mCRC successfully treated by a combination of target agents after the failure of chemotherapy. The patient received palliative resection of primary tumor followed by 9 cycles of postoperative XELOX regimen, cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK)-based biotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine, particle implantation in the lung metastatic lesions. The tumor progressed 20 months after the standard treatments. Then, the regimen cetuximab, bevacizumab and cefitinib was applied. During the treatment with targeted agents, grade IV acne-like rash and relatively severe parionychia of the toes occurred. Both of them recovered smoothly. The PET-CT reexamination at 40 days after the target treatment showed that the metabolism of mediastinal lymph nodes basically recovered to a normal level. The combination of multiple targeted agents obtained a progression-free survival(PFS) of 11 months and the patient with a good quality of life during this period.
