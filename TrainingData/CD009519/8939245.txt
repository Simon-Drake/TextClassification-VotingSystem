Untreated lung cancer: quantification of systematic distortion of tumor size and shape on non-attenuation-corrected 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET scans.
The authors quantitatively evaluated possible distortions of tumor size and shape introduced on non-attenuation-corrected 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans obtained in primary lung cancer tumors. Primary lung cancer tumors in 21 patients were measured on x-ray computed tomography (CT), attenuation-corrected FDG PET, and non-attenuation-corrected FDG PET scans. Apparent anteroposterior tumor dimensions on non-attenuation-corrected FDG PET scans were significantly larger (P = .0007; mean difference, 30%) than on attenuation-corrected FDG PET or CT scans (P = .05; mean difference, 28%). Left-to-right tumor dimensions on non-attenuation-corrected FDG PET scans were significantly smaller than on attenuation-corrected FDG PET scans (P = .03; mean difference, 8.5%) but were not significantly different from those on CT scans (P = .3).
