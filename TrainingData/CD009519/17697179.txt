Horner syndrome.
Horner syndrome is an uncommon but important clinical entity, representing interruption of the sympathetic pathway to the eye and face. Horner syndrome is almost always diagnosed clinically, though pharmacological testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging modalities such as PET, CT and MRI are important components of work-up for patients presenting with acquired Horner syndrome. Our patient's presentation with Horner syndrome unmasked the causative superior sulcus squamous cell carcinoma and a coincidental lower lobe adenocarcinoma. Successful radical treatment of these cancers resulted in complete resolution of the syndrome and disease-free survival at 18 months. We review the anatomy and pathophysiology underlying this and other causes of Horner syndrome.
