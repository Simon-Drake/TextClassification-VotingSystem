Pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor after Hodgkin's lymphoma and application of PET imaging.
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare tumor with a particular histological pattern of myofibroblasts and mixed inflammatory infiltrate. IMT has been rarely described in association with malignancy. This case report is of a 16-year-old male who had Hodgkin's disease (stage IVA) and who after chemotherapy and radiotherapy developed IMT, 16 months post completion of therapy. The IMT was in the lung in an area which was previously involved with HD and had undergone radiotherapy. PET imaging with F(18)FDG was used in the initial diagnosis and has been used in follow-up after full surgical resection of the lesion.
