Accuracy of standardized uptake value measured by simultaneous emission and transmission scanning in PET oncology.
We assessed the accuracy of the standardized uptake value (SUV) measured by simultaneous emission and transmission scanning in cancer patients using FDG positron emission tomography (PET). Conventional, independent emission (E)/transmission (T) scans and simultaneous E/T scans were conducted consecutively in 30 patients who underwent FDG PET examinations. The SUVs of 35 mass lesions and 34 selected normal tissues were derived from the independent E/T scan and simultaneous E/T scan. Experimental studies using a cylindrical phantom were also conducted to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of the SUV derived from a simultaneous E/T scan. The SUVs of 18F solution in the phantom were estimated to be approximately 1, with high reproducibility in the range of total counts observed in the clinical examinations. There were no significant differences in the SUVs in 35 tumours derived from simultaneous E/T scans and those derived from independent scans, and there was a strong positive correlation between the two (r = 0.99, P < 0.01). There were also no significant differences in the SUVs in 34 normal tissue regions derived from simultaneous E/T scans and those derived from independent scans. In conclusion, simultaneous E/T scanning with FDG in patients with malignant tumours is a valid method, since the SUV derived from the simultaneous scan is accurate and reproducible.
