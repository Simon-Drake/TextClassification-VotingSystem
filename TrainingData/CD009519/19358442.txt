Radiofrequency ablation of primary and metastatic lung cancers.
Radiofrequency ablation is an accepted method of therapy for unresectable liver cancer. Most recently, interest in using this technology for treatment of primary and metastatic lung tumors has increased. Early animal studies have led to numerous human trials that suggest that radiofrequency ablation can play a major role in treatment of both early-stage primary lung cancer and metastatic lesions. Technical aspects of this therapy as well as areas of further research are discussed.
