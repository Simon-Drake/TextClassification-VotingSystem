Ground-glass opacities on thin-section helical CT: differentiation between bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to investigate the differentiation between bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia manifesting pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) based on selected features on thin-section helical CT scans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 35 bronchioloalveolar carcinomas and 17 atypical adenomatous hyperplasias that were histologically confirmed and that manifested pure GGO on thin-section helical CT scans. We recorded the age, sex, and smoking history (Brinkman index) of the patients. Two board-certified radiologists measured the maximum diameter and mean attenuation value of the nodules; the measured values were averaged for each nodule. Using a 3-point scale, they visually assessed the images for consensus with respect to nodular sphericity, marginal irregularity, vascular convergence, pleural retraction, and findings of an internal air bronchogram. CT findings of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma were compared using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis; the odds ratio was computed using the atypical adenomatous hyperplasia group as the reference group. RESULTS: By univariate analysis, the patient age, nodular maximum diameter, mean attenuation value, and findings of an internal air bronchogram were statistically significantly associated with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10 [p = 0.012], OR = 1.27 [p < 0.01], OR = 1.01 [p = 0.023], and OR = 25.30 [p < 0.001], respectively), and sphericity was significantly associated with atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (OR = 0.059, p < 0.001). By multivariate analysis, sphericity was significantly associated with atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (OR = 0.125, p = 0.042) and findings of an internal air bronchogram were associated with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (OR = 16.10, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Nodular sphericity and an internal air bronchogram were useful at thin-section helical CT performed to differentiate between bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Interobserver agreement was high for each finding.
