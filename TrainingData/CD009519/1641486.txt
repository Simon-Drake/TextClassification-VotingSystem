[Positron emission tomography of the thorax. The current clinical status].
The non-invasive diagnostic assessment of thoracic lesions has been greatly enhanced by the use of positron emission tomography with metabolic active radio-compounds such as fluor-18 labeled deoxyglucose. Four clinical fields of use were established: differential diagnostic evaluation of lesions (T-staging); classification of adenopathy (N-staging); therapy response monitoring; diagnostic evaluation of recurrence. The upcoming challenges for clinical use are limited availability and necessary technical and qualitative standardizations.
