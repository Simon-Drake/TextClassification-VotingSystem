18F FDG-PET/CT findings in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is an indolent and primary disease of the larynx and the trachea and rarely extends to smaller airways. F-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) evaluation in this condition has not been reported earlier. We report FDG-PET/CT findings in a case of RRP that included a large papillomatous lung mass resembling cancer.
