FDG-PET maximum standardised uptake value is associated with variation in survival: analysis of 498 lung cancer patients.
We sought to establish the extent to which tumour uptake of [18F]-fluoro2-deoxy-glucose is associated with survival in patients with primary lung cancer. From our analysis of data concerning 498 lung cancer patients, including surgical and non-surgical cases, we conclude that there is a clear association between higher tumour uptake of glucose and worse survival.
