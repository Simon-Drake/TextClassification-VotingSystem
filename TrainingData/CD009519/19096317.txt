Unexpected slight fluorodeoxyglucose-uptake on positron emission tomography in a pulmonary hamartoma.
We report the case of a patient with suspected hamartoma with slight fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET). Initially, follow-up with repeat computed tomography (CT) scan was proposed. Because of the risk for retro-obstructive pneumonia, and because there was a small increase in diameter of the lesion on CT, thoracotomy was proposed. Pathologic examination revealed a surprising and rare finding.
