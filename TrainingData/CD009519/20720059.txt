Is 18F-FDG PET/CT useful for the early prediction of histopathologic response to neoadjuvant erlotinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer?
UNLABELLED: Early prediction of treatment response is of value in avoiding the unnecessary toxicity of ineffective treatment. The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the role of integrated (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the early identification of response to neoadjuvant erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. METHODS: From October 2006 to March 2009, 23 patients with non-small cell lung cancer eligible for surgical resection were evaluated for this study. Patients received preoperative erlotinib (150 mg) once daily for 3 wk. (18)F-FDG PET/CT was performed before and at 1 wk after the administration of erlotinib. Changes in tumor (18)F-FDG uptake during treatment were measured by standardized uptake values and assessed prospectively according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. Patients with a decrease in standardized uptake values of 25% or more after 1 wk were classified as "metabolic responders." The metabolic response was compared with the pathologic response, obtained by histopathologic examination of the resected specimen. RESULTS: Following the (18)F-FDG PET/CT criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, 6 patients (26%) had a partial response within 1 wk, 16 patients (70%) had stable disease, and 1 patient (4%) had progressive disease. The median percentage of necrosis in the early metabolic responder group was 70% (interquartile range, 30%-91%), and the median percentage of necrosis in the nonresponder group was 40% (interquartile range, 20%-50%; P = 0.09). The kappa-agreement between the metabolic and pathologic responders was 0.55 (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that early during the course of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, (18)F-FDG PET/CT can predict response to erlotinib treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
