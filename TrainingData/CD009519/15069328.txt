F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-positive benign adrenal cortical adenoma: imaging features and pathologic correlation.
Accurate characterization of adrenal lesions in lung cancer is essential in the staging of the disease. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging as well as fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging are used to differentiate adrenal metastases from benign adenomas. Although FDG-PET is highly accurate in this regard, benign adrenal cortical adenomas have been shown to accumulate FDG, although to a lesser degree. We present a patient with a history of lung cancer and FDG accumulation in a benign adenoma, probably reflecting areas of chronic inflammation also seen within the gland at pathology.
