[Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung].
Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a neuroendocrine tumor comprising a subgroup of large cell carcinoma and is a type of lung cancer showing a neuroendocrine characteristic similar to that of small cell lung carcinoma In our institution, we started to diagnose LCNEC by immunostaining in 2002, and we herein report 9 patients diagnosed with LCNEC from January 2002 to May 2008. The average patient age was 74.9, male/female ratio was 8/1, and all 9 patients had a smoking history. Pathological stages IA/IB/IIB/IIIA comprised 4/1/2/2, respectively. Peripherally located and lobulated tumors were noted on preoperative computed tomography (CT), and moderate uptake of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which balanced with the size, was recognized on positron emission tomography (PET). All 9 patients underwent surgery and 7 underwent radical surgery. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was performed for 4 patients. Three showed recurrence, and 2 of these 3 died of the primary disease. The remaining 7 patients have survived to date. The possibility of LCNEC must be considered when peripherally located lung cancer with lobulation is noted on CT and shows moderate uptake of FDG for its size on PET, and multimodal treatment is needed if the diagnosis is determined postoperatively.
