[Performance of degree of accumulation with 201Tl-SPECT in 13 cases of lung cancer smaller than 2 cm].
The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity of 201Tl-chloride for small lung cancers. The study subjects consisted of 13 cases of surgically verified lung cancer smaller than 2 cm who had undergone 201Tl-SPECT prior to surgery, owing to the difficulty of establishing a diagnosis of lung cancer based on diagnostic CT. Among 13 cases, four showed positive accumulation in early and delayed SPECT, and nine negative, with a degree of accumulation of 31% (4/13).
