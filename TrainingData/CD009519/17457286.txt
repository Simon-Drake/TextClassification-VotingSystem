[Three-year survival after treatment of a primary pulmonary angiosarcoma].
We report an observation of angiosarcoma of the pulmonary artery in a 65-year-old man hospitalized for acute dyspnea revealing a left mass hilaire which arose from the pulmonary artery before the development of obstructive endobronchial extension. The therapeutic sequence associated removal of the lobar bronchus obstruction by interventional endoscopy, chemotherapy using ifosfamide-doxorubicin, complete left pneumonectomy and auxiliary chemotherapy with 2 additional cycles. The patient was free of tumor relapse at nearly 3 years follow-up.
