Partnerships in oncology and radiology: the role of radiology in the detection, staging, and follow-up of lung cancer.
In this review, I examine the multifaceted role of radiology in the diagnosis, staging, and management of lung cancer, highlighting new applications and modalities such as computer-aided detection of lung nodules and positron emission tomography/computed tomography for staging and monitoring response to therapy. Lung cancer screening is also discussed.
