The prognostic value of positron emission tomography in non-small cell lung cancer: analysis of 266 cases.
UNLABELLED: Positron emission tomography (PET) is more accurate than computed tomography (CT) in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed the prognostic value of PET for survival in NSCLC patients. METHODS: Consecutive patients with proven NSCLC with PET for staging were selected. Staging by laboratory tests, bronchoscopy, chest X-ray, and CT was performed in all patients, leading to a clinical stage (c-TNM) prior to PET. A separate classification (pet-TNM) was obtained from PET images by observers blinded to clinical data. We performed univariate survival analysis with ECOG performance score, sex, weight loss, comorbidity, histology, c-TNM, and pet-TNM as variables. Cox regression analysis was performed with significant variables from the univariate analyses. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-six patients were included, 205 men and 61 women. c-TNM and pet-TNM were identical in 150 (56%) patients, 69 were upstaged, and 47 were downstaged by PET. At time of analysis, 198 (74%) patients had died. Univariate analysis showed significant survival differences for ECOG performance score (0 versus 1/2), weight loss (<10% versus >or=10%), pulmonary comorbidity, c-TNM, and pet-TNM (stage IA versus IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IV). Cox regression analysis identified pet-TNM as the most significant (p < 0.001) prognostic factor, followed by ECOG performance score (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Tumor stage as determined by PET is the most significant prognostic factor for survival in patients with NSCLC.
