A case of small cell lung cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by photodynamic therapy.
Here, we present the case of a 51-year-old man with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The patient was diagnosed as having LS-SCLC with an endobronchial mass in the left main bronchus. Following concurrent chemoradiotherapy, a mass remaining in the left lingular division was treated with PDT. Clinical and histological data indicate that the patient has remained in complete response for 2 years without further treatment. This patient represents a rare case of complete response in LS-SCLC treated with PDT.
