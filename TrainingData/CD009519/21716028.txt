Diagnosis of synchronous isolated splenic metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma: complementary role of FDG PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MRI.
Isolated splenic metastasis is extremely rare. In this study, we report a case of a 52-year-old man referred for Pancoast Tobias Syndrome by which FDG PET/CT detected an isolated splenic metastasis. Diffusion-weighted MRI confirmed the isolated splenic lesion. A low apparent diffusion coefficient was consistent with a tumor lesion. CT-guided biopsy of both the lesions and histopathologic findings confirmed a lung adenocarcinoma with an isolated splenic metastasis. This case reveals a very rare occurrence of isolated splenic metastases in the context of lung cancer and illustrates the role of multimodality functional imaging for the early detection of uncommon metastasis.
