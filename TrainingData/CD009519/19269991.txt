Clinical value of whole-body FDG-PET for recurrent gastric cancer: a multicenter study.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for suspected recurrent gastric cancer. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 92 consecutive patients who underwent PET [either integrated PET/computed tomography (CT) or manual fusion of dedicated PET and CT] scans for post-treatment surveillance of gastric cancer between June 2006 and December 2007. Of these patients, 46 patients were suspected of recurrence by other imaging modalities (Group A), 19 patients were suspected of recurrence by tumor markers without definite findings (Group B) and the remaining 27 patients underwent a PET scan without evidence of recurrence (Group C). The diagnostic performance and prevalence of the clinical impact of FDG-PET were analyzed. RESULTS: Recurrence of gastric cancer was confirmed in 31 patients (67%) in Group A, in 11 patients (58%) in Group B and in 2 patients (7%) in Group C. In addition, colon cancer (n = 3), lung cancer (n = 1) and pulmonary carcinoid (n = 1) were identified in five patients (5%). In patient-basis, the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of PET for recurrence were 81%, 87% and 83%, respectively, in Group A, 73%, 88% and 79%, respectively, in Group B and 50%, 88% and 85%, respectively, in Group C. Therapeutic management was influenced by PET results in 22 patients (48%) in Group A, in 8 patients (42%) in Group B and in 2 patients (7%) in Group C, including cases in which PET was helpful for detecting second primary cancer. CONCLUSIONS: PET with FDG yielded useful information in patients with suspected recurrent gastric cancer, especially when recurrence was suspected in the clinical setting.
