Peripheral lung carcinoma: correlation of angiogenesis and first-pass perfusion parameters of 64-detector row CT.
PURPOSE: To investigate the value of 64-detector row CT first-pass perfusion imaging in the evaluation of tumor perfusion in patients with lung carcinoma, and to assess the correlation between the perfusion parameters and tumor angiogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six surgically peripheral lung carcinomas were examined with 64-detector row CT. First-pass CT perfusion study comprised of 12 repeated spiral acquisitions over 60s following a 50-ml intravenous bolus of contrast medium at 6-7 ml/s. Tumor specimens were assessed for microvessel density (MVD). Perfusion, peak enhancement intensity (PEI), time to peak (TTP), and blood volume (BV) and MVD of the tumor were compared by means of one-way ANOVA analysis of variance among histological type, size, metastasis and necrosis. Pearson correlation coefficients were conducted to represent the relationships between the perfusion parameters and MVD of the tumor. RESULTS: Mean values for perfusion, PEI, TTP, and BV of the 46 tumors were 70.3+/-39.4 ml/min/ml, 67.0+/-37.6 HU, 36.9+/-11.2s, and 34.9+/-17.9 ml/100g, respectively. No statistically significant differences in perfusion parameters were found among different histological types (p>0.05). Considerable differences with higher perfusion, PEI and BV were noted in tumor < or = 3.0 cm than in tumor>3.0 cm (p<0.05). No statistically significant differences were found between nodule metastasis positive and negative groups (p>0.05). The necrotic tumors showed significantly lower perfusion, PEI and BV compared with non-necrotic tumors (p<0.05). Perfusion, PEI, and BV of the necrotic part manifested significantly lower, but TTP longer, than those of non-necrotic part of the necrotic tumors (p<0.05). Perfusion, PEI and BV were positively correlated with extent of MVD (r=0.715, 0.681, 0.762, respectively, all p<0.001), whereas no significant correlation was found between TTP and MVD (r=-0.154, p>0.05). CONCLUSION: 64-detector row CT first-pass perfusion imaging is a valuable noninvasive method in evaluating tumor perfusion of peripheral lung carcinoma. CT perfusion parameters can be indicators for evaluating tumor necrosis and angiogenesis.
