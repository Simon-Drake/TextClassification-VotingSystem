Primary pulmonary T-cell lymphoma: a case report.
Primary pulmonary T-cell lymphoma is an extremely rare malady, and we diagnosed this in a 52-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital with cough for the previous two weeks. The chest CT demonstrated multiple variable sized mass-like consolidations with low density central necrosis in the peripheral portion of both the upper and lower lobes. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed multiple areas of hypermetabolic fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in both lungs with central metabolic defects, which correlated with central necrosis seen on CT. The histological sample showed peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the not otherwise specified form. The follow-up CT scan showed an increased extent of the multifocal consolidative lesions despite that the patient had undergone chemotherapy.
