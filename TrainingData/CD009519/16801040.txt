Virtual bronchoscopy for diagnosis of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
Virtual bronchoscopy is a new method for viewing helical/spiral computed tomography (CT) images of the tracheobronchial trees. Using commercially available software to process the CT data, the tracheobronchial trees can be inspected through a series of three-dimensional images. Recently, this technique has been increasingly used to detect benign and malignant airway stenosis. We report the findings of virtual bronchoscopy in a 41-year-old man with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). Several tiny nodules were evident in the lower trachea. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed 1 month later during a planned surgery for laryngeal papillomas, and the findings were in agreement with virtual bronchoscopy. Detection of intrabronchial spreading in RRP is important since peripheral seeding of RRP can cause complications, including recurrent pneumonia, obstructive atelectasis, hemoptysis, and, rarely, may degenerate to squamous cell carcinoma. Virtual bronchoscopy is an alternative method for inspecting the tracheobronchial trees in patients with RRP when laryngeal papillomas impede fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
