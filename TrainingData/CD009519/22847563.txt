Stage IV malignant melanoma of unknown primary site in a young man.
Metastatic melanoma of unknown primary is a rare entity with low life expectancy. Inoperable metastatic malignant melanoma in lungs has a survival rate of <6%. Regression of the primary lesion is a well-documented theory in the literature, since melanoma is one of the tumours that can undergo regression. We present a case of a young man with metastatic malignant melanoma in lungs, whose survival duration is longer than expected even without metastasectomy.
