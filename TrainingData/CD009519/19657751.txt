Micrometastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient: a case report and discussion.
Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have an increased risk of malignancies such as Kaposi's sarcoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cervical cancer, but the relative risk of other malignancies such as papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is not well documented. The report describes the case of a 52-year-old HIV-infected Haitian male who presented with PTC. A post (131)I therapy whole body scan (WBS) showed abnormal uptake in several areas indicating the presence of a number of micro-metastases. Our case raises the question not only as to the role of HIV infection in predisposition to PTC, but also how it alters the clinical course of the tumor.
