[Pulmonary embolism diagnosed during an endobronchial ultrasound procedure].
INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary embolism occurs frequently in lung cancer. The clinical features are non-specific and the diagnosis is often missed. CASE REPORT: A 60-year old man presented with a right upper lobe mass associated with right hilar adenopathy. Both had activity on positron emission tomography. As bronchoscopy was normal, an endobronchial, ultrasound guided, transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) was performed to obtain a diagnosis. During the procedure, a hypoechogenic image was seen in the right pulmonary artery. A CT pulmonary angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of right pulmonary embolism. The transbronchial needle aspiration confirmed the neoplastic nature of the adenopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a pulmonary embolism diagnosed by EBUS. This observation confirms the results of a recently published study showing that known pulmonary embolism can be detected by EBUS. CONCLUSION: Although EBUS is not the classic tool for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, it seems advisable to undertake a careful examination of the proximal pulmonary artery during an EBUS procedure.
