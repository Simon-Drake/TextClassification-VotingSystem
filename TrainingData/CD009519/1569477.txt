Carbon-11-methionine and PET is an effective method to image head and neck cancer.
Methionine metabolism is altered in cancer, and methionine labeled with 11C has been successfully used for imaging of brain, lung, and breast cancer and lymphoma. Uptake of L-[methyl-11C]methionine (11C-methionine) in head and neck cancer of 23 patients was studied with PET. Accumulation of 11C-methionine in the tumors was assessed by two different methods: the influx constant, Ki, and the standardized uptake value (SUV). All 23 cancers accumulated 11C-methionine. The mean Ki was 0.147 +/- 0.070 min-1 and the mean SUV 8.5 +/- 3.5. There was a strong correlation between the two measures of tumor uptake (r = 0.92, p less than 0.0001). There was no correlation between the uptake of 11C-methionine and the histological grade of cancer. Head and neck cancer can thus be effectively imaged with 11C-methionine. Carbon-11-methionine PET imaging may be useful in delineating tumors for therapy planning.
