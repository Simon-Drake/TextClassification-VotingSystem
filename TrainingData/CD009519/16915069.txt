Primary pulmonary meningioma manifesting as a solitary pulmonary nodule with a false-positive PET scan.
Primary pulmonary meningioma is very rare, with about 30 cases reported in the English literature. These lesions are usually benign, grow slowly, and have an excellent prognosis. However, they can mimic any other pulmonary tumor, as the most common presentation is as a solitary pulmonary nodule. We report a case of a primary pulmonary meningioma manifesting as a solitary lung nodule with a very high metabolic activity on the positron emission tomography, mimicking a primary lung cancer.
