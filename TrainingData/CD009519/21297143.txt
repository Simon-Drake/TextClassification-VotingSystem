An intra-parenchymal pulmonary lipoma with a high activity on positron emission tomography scan.
Benign pulmonary tumours are a less frequent differential diagnosis of the more common malignant pulmonary tumours. They usually present in the younger age groups and are almost invariably inactive on positron emission tomography (PET) studies. We report a unique case of peripheral pulmonary lipoma in an 81-year-old female which showed increased activity on PET.
