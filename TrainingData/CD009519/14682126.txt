[The role of positron emission tomography with C18-Fluorodeoxyglucose in clinical oncology].
The study was concerned with evaluation of the diagnostic potential of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-FDG in clinical oncology and elucidation of its role in assessing therapy effectiveness. The Ecat Exact 47 and Ecat Exat HR+ (Siemens) insatllations were used to examine 674 patients, with Whole Body protocol used in 585. PET with 18-FDG proved highly effective in diagnosing malignancies of the breast, lung, liver, pancreas, testis, brain and lymphoma as well as evaluating the efficacy of therapy.
