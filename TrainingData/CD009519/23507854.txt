In vivo mouse <formula>^{99m}</formula>Tc SPECT scans with bioluminescence imaging validation.
The aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the feasibility of <formula>^{99m}</formula>Tc-labeled cartilage link protein (CLP) probe for the single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of lung cancer. Xenograft mouse model were established from a luciferase expressing cell line derived from a human lung cancer. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was carried out prior to <formula>^{99m}</formula>Tc-CLP and <formula>^{99m}</formula>Tc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) SPECT scans. The image quality of <formula>^{99m}</formula>Tc-CLP scan was validated with BLI and compared with well established <formula>^{99m}</formula>Tc-MIBI scan. Results of multimodal imaging analyses suggested that <formula>^{99m}</formula>Tc-CLP was a sensitive and reliable SPECT agent for lung cancer imaging.
