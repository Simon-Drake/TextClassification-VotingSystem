Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of the lung: the role of positron emission tomography in diagnosis.
Pulmonary nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH) is defined as reactive lymphoid proliferation forming solitary or multiple nodules or localized infiltrates localized in the lungs. Radiological presentations are generally solitary or multiple nodules, but air bronchograms and ground glass attenuation may be present. Patients mostly asymptomatic and the lesions were detected coincidentally on routine chest X-rays. We present a case of NLH with cavitary lesion arising in the lung of a 61 year-old man who admitted with cough and massive hemoptysis. The lesion had positive fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake. To our knowledge, this is the only patient reported in the literature presenting with massive hemoptysis and a cavitary lesion with positive FDG uptake.
