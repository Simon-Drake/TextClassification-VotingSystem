[Results of FDG-PET scanning in the pre-operative staging of broncho-pulmonary tumors].
BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has recently established itself as an important imaging strategy in the management of respectable non-small cell bronchial carcinoma (NSCLC). In this study we report our experience of the impact of FDG-PET in the pre-operative assessment of NSCLC. METHODS: In a single centre retrospective study between 01 January 2000 and 31 Dec 2002, 108 FDGPET scans were performed during the preoperative assessment of histologically proven or strongly suspected NSCLC. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FDG-PET for the characterization of a parenchymatous opacity were 96%, 71% and 92% respectively (4 false negatives, 5 false positives). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for mediastinal node involvement were 62%, 94% and 84% respectively (10 false negatives and 4 false positives). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the characterization of adrenal nodules were 88%, 100% and 97% (1 false negative) and for satellite pulmonary nodules 50%, 75% and 64% (2 false negatives and 3 false positives). CONCLUSION: FDG-PET is a useful imaging modality in the pre-operative management of NSCLC but is limited particularly in the characterization of lesions less than 10 mm in diameter and in the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes.
