Value of positron emission tomography for lung cancer staging.
OBJECTIVE: The therapeutic strategy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) requires exact staging of tumour invasion (T) as well as differentiation between ipsi- and contralateral lymph node invasion (N1/2 vs N3). [18F]FDG-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been shown to detect invaded N with high accuracy while correct determination of T appears to be unclear. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate benefit and necessity of 18FDG-PET as an additive to conventional staging modalities. METHODS: Forty patients with suspected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were staged by means of computed tomography (CT), bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy and bone scintigraphy. Additionally, attenuation corrected FDG-PET of the thorax was performed pre-operatively for analysis of T and N topography. After surgical resection with radical lymphadenectomy T and N staging results of CT and PET were compared with the pathological diagnoses. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and accuracy of CT and PET were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty three squamous cell carcinomas, 14 adenocarcinomas, and three non-malignant tumours were found. Accuracy of CT-T was 0.75 and of PET-T 0.78; accuracy of CT-N was 0.78 and of PET-N 0.80. By combination of CT-T and PET-T accuracy was 0.88. Combination of CT-N and PET-N yielded an accuracy of 0.90. In two out of three cases, PET correctly determined T0. In two cases non-malignant inflammatory lymph nodes were falsely staged as malignant by PET. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate pre-operative T- and N-staging is possible with both CT and FDG-PET. Accuracy can be improved by combination of CT and FDG-PET. FDG-PET is superior to CT in order to differentiate between malignant and benign tumours. However, acute inflammation can mimic malignant lymph node invasion. FDG-PET is justified as a supporting staging measure in cases presenting unclear differentiation between N2 and N3 after conventional staging and is helpful in cases with unclear cell type of the primary tumour.
