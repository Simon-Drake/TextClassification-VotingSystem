Mediastinal staging of lung cancer with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and a dual-head coincidence gamma camera.
The aims of the present study were (a) to evaluate mediastinal staging in patients with lung cancer with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) using a coincidence gamma camera (hybrid PET) in comparison with dedicated positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), and (b) to assess the feasibility to determine standardized uptake values (SUV) with hybrid PET. Forty patients were included in the study. Hybrid PET was performed without and with attenuation correction. Data were rebinned with single-slice (SSRB) or Fourier rebinning (FORE). The SUVs of primary tumors were calculated with hybrid PET and compared with SUVs determined by dedicated PET. Diagnostic accuracy for hybrid with or without attenuation correction was 80 or 74% compared with 82% for dedicated PET, and 63% for CT. Attenuation-corrected hybrid PET revealed a higher specificity than CT (83 vs 52%; p<0.05). The SUVs of primary tumors were similar to those of hybrid PET and dedicated PET with a mean relative difference of 20.8+/-16.4%. The FORE improved the agreement of SUVs with a mean relative difference of 13.8+/-9.9 vs 36.0+/-17.9% for SSRB ( p<0.001). Hybrid PET with attenuation correction is more specific than CT for mediastinal staging in patients with lung cancer ( p<0.05). It reveals similar results in comparison with dedicated PET. Calculation of SUVs with hybrid PET is feasible.
