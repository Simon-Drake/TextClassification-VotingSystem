[Adrenalectomy for metastatic adrenal tumor from uterine leiomyosarcoma: a case report].
A 63-year-female was referred to our department for close examination and treatment of a left adrenal tumor found by positron emission tomography and computed tomography. She underwent abdominal total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine leiomyosarcoma 19 years ago. After the operation, she received 2 resections for peritoneal recurrence and 7 resections for pulmonary metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous mass with a diameter of 7 cm at the left adrenal grand. We carried out open adrenalectomy and pathological findings were a metastatic adrenal tumor from uterine leiomyosarcoma. No signs of recurrence or metastasis have been observed for 6 months after the operation.
