Multifocal nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of the lung differently identified by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).
Nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH) is a rare lung disease classified as a non-neoplastic pulmonary lymphoid lesion. It is believed that 36 % of cases present with multifocal lesions, and although there are some reports in which (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) results are positive, the FDG uptakes vary and the imaging findings are very similar to those of lung cancer or malignant lymphoma. We present a case of surgically resected multifocal NLH which was differently identified by chest computed (CT) tomography appearance and FDG-PET findings.
