[Slow progression of a ground glass lesion - need for long term vigilance].
INTRODUCTION: The identification of a ground-glass opacity on chest CT is a frequent problem because of the number of exams performed. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a man of 66 years with a very slowly increasing ground-glass opacity during 5 years. Although the lesion was negative for positron emission tomography and because of its increasing size and the appearance of a solid part, our patient underwent surgery. The final diagnosis was stage I adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The management of a ground glass opacity differs from solid nodules of the lung. The rate of malignancy is high in the published studies, especially in south-east Asia. PET is not as useful as for solid nodules. Long term follow up is necessary because of the long doubling time in these neoplasms.
