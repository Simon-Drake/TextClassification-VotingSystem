[Image-guided biopsy of the thorax].
Image-guided biopsy of the lung or of the mediastinum is a minimally invasive method for acquiring material for microbiologic or histologic examinations. Given careful selection and preparation of the patient, image-guided biopsy is a safe procedure with a relatively low risk of complications. The aim of this tutorial is to summarize the special aspects concerning the intervention, including evaluation, the technical needs, different kinds of access to the target, and risk and complication management.
