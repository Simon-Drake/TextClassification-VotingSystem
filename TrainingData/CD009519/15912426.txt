In vivo follow-up of rat tumor models with 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose/dual-head coincidence gamma camera imaging.
UNLABELLED: Before studying the impact of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) imaging with a dual-head coincidence gamma camera (DHC) for the follow-up of animal tumor models, we wanted to optimize this technique. METHODS: Three different animal tumor models (osteosarcoma, melanoma, and breast cancer) were studied after FDG injection. Dynamic and dual time point FDG/DHC imaging were studied from one hour to five hours postinjection. In vitro tumor cell FDG uptake was assessed in eight different tumor cell lines. In one model (osteosarcoma), tumor growth, lung metastasis emergence, and survival were assessed by classical clinical follow-up and compared to FDG imaging in a control group (n = 6) and in a group treated by endostatin liposome complexes (n = 6). RESULTS: Images obtained five hours after injection were more reliable for tumor growth follow-up than standard images (one hour). In vitro tumor cell FDG uptake confirmed in vivo imaging studies. In eight different tumor cell lines the FDG uptake was higher after five hours incubation than after one hour (p < 0.002). With FDG follow-up, we found that FDG uptake was strongly correlated with survival and that lung metastasis larger than 5 mm could be detected. CONCLUSION: Using the optimization proposed above, DHC/FDG functional imaging seems to be a powerful tool to study rat tumor models and to help develop novel cancer therapies.
