Pre-clinical evaluation of a new indirectly labeled (9)(9)mTc-6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carboxylic acid (HYNIC)-depreotide with HYNIC as bifunctional chelator.
BACKGROUND: Technetium-99m or (99m)Tc is widely used for labeling peptide in nuclear medicine. Somatostatin and its analog can inhibit tumor cell growth after binding with its receptor. This research was to study the preclinical effect of a new (99m)Tc-6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carboxylic acid (HYNIC)-depreotide, indirect (99m)Tc labeling of depreotide using HYNIC as a bifunctional chelator. METHODS: The cyclopeptide, cyclo-[(N-Me) Phe-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Hcy], the linear peptide, and [ClCH(2)-COxb-Dap-Lys- Cys-Lysxamide] were synthesized by Fmoc solid-phase synthesis. The cyclopeptide and the linear peptide were linked by liquid-phase synthesis. The product depreotide was isolated and purified by high performance liquid chromatography and was confirmed by mass spectrography. Depreotide was labeled with (99m)Tc through a direct labeling method, using HYNIC as a bifunctional chelator. Paper chromatography method was used to calculate the labeling rate, and through the comparative analysis selected the best mark conditions. The new (99m)Tc-HYNIC-depreotide was tested by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The internalization and externalization rates of the new (99m)Tc-HYNIC-depreotide were studied in A549 cells. Furthermore, biodistribution of the radiopeptide was studied in nude mice, bearing tumors from human lung carcinoma cells SPC-A1. RESULTS: The molecular of synthesize depreotide was 1358, and the purity of it was 95.29%. The labeling efficiency of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-depreotide was highest at pH 6.0 and 15 degrees C, about (70.95 +/- 0.84)%. The labeling rate of the new (99m)Tc-HYNIC-depreotide rose to a peak of (20.75 +/- 0.48)% at 60 minutes in A549 cells at 37 degrees C and decreased slightly later, while it elevated gradually during the time course at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The internalization rate of the new (99m)Tc-HYNIC-depreotide at 37 degrees C increased gradually and reached the peak of 84.4% in 120 minutes, while the externalization rate of the new (99m)Tc-HYNIC-depreotide was always less than 20%. In mice bearing the experimental SPC-A1 tumor, the new (99m)Tc-HYNIC-depreotide demonstrated a high tumor uptake of (4.05 +/- 0.04)% ID/g at 1.5 hpi and remained high ((2.51 +/- 0.06)% ID/g) at 4 hpi. The tumor-to-lung activity concentration ratio (T/Lu) was very high for the new (99m)Tc-HYNIC-depreotide at all time points. So did the tumor-to-muscle activity (T/Mu) and tumor-to-blood activity concentration ratios (T/Bl). CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that the new (99m)Tc-HYNIC-depreotide might be a promising candidate radiopharmaceutical for imaging somatostatin receptor positive lung cancer.
