Isolated pulmonary amyloidomas: report of 3 cases with histologic and imaging findings.
Amyloid tumors presenting as lung masses are rare. We report 3 patients seen over a 2-year period with multiple lung masses, 2 that were suspicious for metastasis, and one in a patient with chest pain. Pathologic evaluation demonstrated amyloid tumor in each case. Two demonstrated a prominent macrophage giant cell reaction; scattered polyclonal plasma cells were present in two of the cases. PET scanning of 2 of the patients revealed an SUV of 1.9 and 4.0, respectively. Short-term follow-up revealed that none of the 3 cases were associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. This small series and a literature review suggest that pulmonary amyloidomas are usually isolated lesions, and that PET may show increased uptake simulating a neoplasm.
