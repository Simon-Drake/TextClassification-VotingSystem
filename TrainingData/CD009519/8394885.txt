Lung tumor metastasis to breast detected by fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET.
We report a case of breast metastasis from a large-cell bronchogenic adenocarcinoma. Serial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) was used to monitor the response of the primary lesion to radiation therapy. In the 7-wk interval between studies, an area of markedly increased FDG uptake appeared in the right breast. On subsequent biopsy this proved to be a metastatic deposit from the primary lesion. breast metastasis is uncommon. The ability of FDG-PET to detect metastatic lesions from primary lung tumor is variable. In this case, the finding of the new breast lesion resulted in introduction of chemotherapy to the treatment program.
