Is there a cut-off value for standardized uptake values in positron emission tomography for predicting response to treatment and survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer? Single center experience.
PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important imaging technique for the diagnosis and staging of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we evaluated the standardized uptake values (SUV) of PET in NSCLC patients to determine whether there was a cut-off value for predicting response to treatment and survival. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 149 patients with locally advanced NSCLC. All the patients were staged by PET-computerized tomography (CT) after diagnosis. 18fluoro-2-deoxyribose (FDG) was used as the PET tracer. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect whether any prognostic factors were related to response to treatment. RESULTS: The median patient age was 60 years and the median follow-up time 10.3 months. One-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 31% and 58.7%, respectively. The median OS was 15.4 months. Stage, sex and response to treatment were important factors for OS and PFS. We defined a cut-off value for SUVmax (the highest standardized uptake value for all cross sectional areas) as 10.8 by using ROC analysis. Multivariate analysis identified response to treatment as the most significant (p<0.05) prognostic factor for OS. Logistic regression analysis showed that SUVmax and weight loss were important for response to treatment. CONCLUSION: Multivariate analysis indicated that whilst response to treatment was an important factor for predicting survival, the SUVmax was also significant for determining response to therapy and a cut-off value for SUVmax was defined as 10.8.
