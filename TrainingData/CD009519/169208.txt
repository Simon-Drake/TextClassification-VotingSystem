Tracheobronchial resection and reconstruction. A report of five cases.
During the past six years, five patients have undergone tracheal or tracheobronchial reconstruction in our Department. In three patients, a segmental tracheal resection was performed because of post-tracheostomy stricture or cylindroma of the trachea. Two patients were treated for a carcinoid type of bronchial adenoma--one by sleeve resection of an intermediate bronchus and one by pneumonectomy with partial resection and reconstruction of part of the trachea. The exact location, length and nature of the lesions were demonstrated by endoscopy, tomography and tracheobronchography. The surgical and anesthetic problems associated with tracheobronchial reconstruction are discussed.
