MRI of pulmonary nodules: technique and diagnostic value.
Chest wall invasion by a tumour and mediastinal masses are known to benefit from the superior soft tissue contrast of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, helical computed tomography (CT) (i.e. with multiple row detector systems) remains the modality of choice to detect and follow lesions of the lung parenchyma. Since minimizing radiation exposure plays a minor role in oncologic patients, there are only few routine indications for which MRI of lung parenchyma is preferred to CT. This includes whole body MR imaging for staging or scientific studies with frequent follow-up examinations. MR-based lung imaging in this context was always considered as a weak point. Depending on the sequence technique and imaging conditions (i.e. ability to hold breath) the threshold for lung nodule detection with MRI using 1.5 T systems was estimated to be above 3-4 mm. The feasibility of lung MRI at 0.3-0.5 T and 3.0 T systems has been demonstrated. The clinical value of time-resolved lung nodule perfusion analysis cannot yet be determined, although the combination of perfusion characteristics with morphologic criteria contributes to estimate the integrity of a solitary lesion.
