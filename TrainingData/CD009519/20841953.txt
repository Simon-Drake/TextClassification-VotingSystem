[A case of colon cancer with multiple lung metastases responding completely to FOLFIRI and FOLFOX therapy].
A 74-year-old man was administered FOLFIRI therapy, followed by modified FOLFOX therapy and FOLFIRI therapy due to ascending colon carcinoma with multiple lung metastases. After 19 months, the tumor marker became normal, and CT and PET-CT revealed the multiple lung metastases had disappeared. He was operated due to stenosis of the ascending colon carcinoma, and is now being treated with chemotherapy due to liver metastasis. There has been no regrowth of lung metastases for 21 months since the disappearance of multiple lung metastases.
