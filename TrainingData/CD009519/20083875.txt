Combination of (18)-FDG and (68)Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT to differentiate endobronchial carcinoids and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors.
Bronchial masses in young patients are a diagnostic challenge as the signs and symptoms are overlapping. Conventional radiological investigations reveal a mass but are not diagnostic and biopsy remains the only means of preoperative diagnosis. Functional imaging is now emerging as an important tool in the evaluation of these patients and may have a potential to suggest a possible diagnosis. A combination of (18) F-FDG PET-CT and (68) Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT scan is one such example, which revealed contrasting findings in two patients that are being presented here.
