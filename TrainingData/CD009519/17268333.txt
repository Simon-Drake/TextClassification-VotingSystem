[Diagnosis of lung cancer. Image guided diagnostic endoscopy].
The scope of fibreoptic bronchoscopy, which has a high sensitivity for biopsy of visible bronchial lesions, has been extended to more difficult areas such as the mediastinum and the periphery of the lung. This has become possible thanks to technical developments in imaging including miniaturised ultrasound transducers, electromagnetic guidance and positron emission tomography. These techniques which are less invasive than mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy and are probably equally cost-effective.
