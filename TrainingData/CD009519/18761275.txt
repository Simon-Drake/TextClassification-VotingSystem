"Mass-ive" infarction: case report and review of myocardial metastatic malignancies.
Metastatic cancers to the heart are uncommon but occur up to 20 to 40 times more frequently than primary tumors of the heart. Cardiac metastases from lung cancer are rarely diagnosed ante mortem and usually cause no symptoms or signs. In this case report cardiac metastasis from a primary adenosquamous cancer of the lung presented as myocardial infarction in a 61-year-old man. His diagnosis was made and confirmed via multimodality imaging of the heart, which is also reviewed in depth.
