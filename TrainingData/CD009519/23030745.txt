[Prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer patients and prognostic importance of PET/CT SUV max value].
INTRODUCTION: This study planned to investigate the maximum standard uptake values (SUV max) at fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) whether associated with survival or not and the effect of demographic, clinical and laboratory data on survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was created by examining retrospectively the records of 101 patients with NSCLC that received a definitive diagnosis and FDG-PET/CT used for staging in our center between May 2006-March 2011. Especially FDG-PET/CT, SUV max and the other clinical, histopathologic, laboratory and treatment parameters that effects prognosis were recorded and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Eighty eight (87.1%) of the patients were men and 13 (12.9%) were women. The average survival period was 10.6 +/- 8.5 (1-49 months) months. The demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters were divided into two groups with the median value of SUV max (12.0). There was not a significant difference in survival between the two groups (p= 0.807). The study showed that advanced stage, presence of metastasis, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, high white blood cell levels, inoperability, low albumin levels and low performance effect negative on survival. CONCLUSION: It was considered that SUV max does not play an important role in the survival period of NSCLC patients. Knowledge of performance condition, serum LDH, leukocyte and albumin values may provide a better prognostic evaluation.
