Radionuclides used for cancer patients are produced by cyclotron or nuclear reactor. Thyroid cancer patients with lung and/or bone metastasis have been successfully treated with 131I for more than 50 years. But for the diagnosis of cancer patients, 99mTc is superior to 131I, and many 99mTc labeled compounds have been developed, such as for the diagnosis of bone metastasis, liver and kidney diseases and so on. Recently PET studies using 18F-labeled FDG have been widely performed and excellent results are reported in many cancer patients such as lung, colorectal, malignant lymphoma, malignant melanoma and so on. Radionuclides with beta emitter are suitable for the therapy of various cancers. 131I labeled anti-CD-20 monoclonal antibodies and 131I-MIBG are used for the therapy of lymphoma and pheochromocytoma, respectively. For the palliation of metastatic bone pain, 89Sr, 153Sm or 186Re is promising, because these radionuclides can be administered on an outpatients basis.
