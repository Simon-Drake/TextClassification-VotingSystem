[Applicability of surgical resection of pulmonary metastases in terms of the activity of primary tumors].
This study examined the prognostic predictability of malignant tumors involving pulmonary metastases by evaluating the primary tumor volume and activity. The maximum diameter of the primary tumor was considered as an index of the tumor volume, and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) derived from positron emission tomography (PET) as an index of the tumor activity. The latter showed a tendency specific to each primary disease, which was also observed in pulmonary metastatic lesions. These indices, however, were not shown to be valid prognostic factors.
