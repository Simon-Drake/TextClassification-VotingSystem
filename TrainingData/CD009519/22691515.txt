Four chamber FDG uptake in the heart: an indirect sign of pulmonary embolism.
A 57-year-old-male presented for whole-body PET with CT for restaging of lung cancer. Besides revealing postradiation changes, we noticed an unusual pattern of FDG uptake in the myocardium, with prominent metabolic uptake involving 4 chambers of the heart. Later that day, the patient was referred to the emergency department for increased heart rate, but otherwise asymptomatic. CT angiography was performed, which showed scattered filling defects in bilateral pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary embolism. The finding of prominent FDG uptake involving all cardiac chambers in this patient is likely related to heart strain caused by acute pulmonary embolism.
