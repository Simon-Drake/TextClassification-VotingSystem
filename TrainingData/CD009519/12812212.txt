Multi-slice/helical computed tomography for lung cancer screening.
Compared to chest radiography, multislice/helical computed tomography (CT) is able to detect lung cancers of smaller size and at an earlier stage, when better outcomes may be possible. However, the rate of detecting benign lung nodules is high using these technologies. False positives can result in undue anxiety and/or additional tests that may be invasive and expensive. Currently evidence does not exist to suggest that detecting early stage lung cancer reduces mortality. Randomized controlled trials are underway to investigate this issue. Presently, even for smokers, screening for lung cancer with multi-slice/helical CT would be premature.
