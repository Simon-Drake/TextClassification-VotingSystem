99mTc-HYNIC-spermine for imaging polyamine transport system-positive tumours: preclinical evaluation.
PURPOSE: F14512 exploiting the polyamine transport system (PTS) for tumour cell delivery has been described as a potent antitumour agent. The optimal use of this compound will require a probe to identify tumour cells expressing a highly active PTS that might be more sensitive to the treatment. The aim of this study was to design and characterize a scintigraphic probe to evaluate its uptake in cancer cells expressing the PTS. METHODS: Three polyamines coupled to a hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC) moiety were synthesized and labelled with 99mTc. Their radiochemical purity was determined by HPLC. The plasma stability of the 99mTc-HYNIC-spermine probe and its capacity to accumulate into PTS-active cells were also evaluated. In vitro internalization was tested using murine melanoma B16/F10 cells and human lung carcinoma A549 cells. Biodistribution was determined in healthy mice and tumour uptake was studied in B16/F10 tumour-bearing mice. A HL-60-Luc human leukaemia model was used to confront single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images obtained with the 99mTc-labelled probe with those obtained by bioluminescence. RESULTS: The 99mTc-HYNIC-spermine probe was selected for its capacity to accumulate into PTS-active cells and its stability in plasma. In vitro studies demonstrated that the probe was internalized in the cells via the PTS. In vivo measurements indicated a tumour to muscle scintigraphic ratio of 7.9+/-2.8. The combined bioluminescence and scintigraphic analyses with the leukaemia model demonstrated that the spermine conjugate accumulates into the tumour cells. CONCLUSION: The 99mTc-HYNIC-spermine scintigraphic probe is potentially useful to characterize the PTS activity of tumours. Additional work is needed to determine if this novel conjugate may be useful to analyse the PTS status of patients with solid tumours.
