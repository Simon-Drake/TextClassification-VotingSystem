[The fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) findings and surgical strategy for pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma].
The pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma is a comparatively rare lung tumor. We operated on 7 patients of the pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma during January, 2009 from December, 2001. We collected the information such as preoperative image findings, surgical methods, and the postoperative course. FDG-PET was performed in 4 patients preoperatively, and there was FDG uptake in 2 patients, and no FDG uptake in 2 patients. In 2 cases with FDG uptake, there was a tendency to increase the tumor diameter during preoperative follow-up. Among 7 patients, 1 patient underwent tumor enucleation, 2 patients underwent partial resection, and 2 patients underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy. Lung biopsy was performed in remaining 2 cases. Because a tumor was located in pulmonary hilum in 1 case, we underwent lung needle biopsy under thoracoscopy. Because another case was a multiple case, and the resection of all lesions was impossibile, we performed lung biopsy (partial resection). In all cases, the recurrence or exacerbation of the tumor was not detected postoperatively. We thought that the findings of FDG-PET reflected proliferation potency of the pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma. The clinical features of the pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma are various. Therefore, the surgical treatment should be determined in each case carefully while considering the FDG-PET findings.
