Solitary pulmonary nodules: optimal slice thickness of high-resolution CT in differentiating malignant from benign.
The purpose of this study was to determine an optimal slice thickness that was efficient in differentiating malignant from benign solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images. For a total of 92 SPNs, four radiologist indicated their confidence level for the malignant or benign SPN on the CT images presented in 1-, 3-, and 5-mm slice thickness. HRCT could be used to differentiate more accurately the malignant nodules from the benign ones using 1-mm-thick sections than 3- or 5-mm-thick sections.
