Primary pulmonary myoepithelial carcinoma.
Primary salivary gland-type tumors of the lung are rare neoplasms. The pulmonary myoepithelial carcinoma belongs to this group. Since it was first described in 1998, we have identified only seven actual cases reported in the literature so far. We describe the case of a non-smoker 60-year-old Caucasian female, who was referred to our institution for the treatment of three peripheral nodules. Her medical history revealed that a wedge resection, for pulmonary myoepithelial carcinoma, was performed in another center 15 months previously. After resection of the current nodules, the histological findings showed three myoepithelial carcinomas of the lung. There was no vascular or lymphatic invasion. The hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were negatives. The patient is doing well without any sign of recurrence. Herein we shall discuss the case of a primary pulmonary myoepithelial carcinoma in a female and propose a brief review of the literature.
