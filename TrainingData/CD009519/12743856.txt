[ECG-triggered MDR-CT for the detection of pulmonary metastases].
PURPOSE: Comparison of multidetector-row CT (MDR-CT) of the chest with and without ECG triggering for the detection of pulmonary metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with malignant tumors underwent CT of the chest. The unenhanced phase was performed with ECG-triggered MDR-CT and the contrast-enhanced phase with helical MDR-CT. The ECG-triggered and standard helical scans were interpreted in separate sessions, with the analysis determining the number and demarcation of the intrapulmonary nodules and the delineation of the mediastinal structure (rated 1 = excellent to 5 = poor). RESULTS: ECG-MDR-CT images detected 38 % more pulmonary nodules than MDR-CT. The detection rate for tumors < 5 mm was 64 % higher in ECG-triggered scans. The median demarcation rating of all pulmonary findings was 2 for ECG-MDR-CT and 3 for MDR-CT. The median demarcation rating of tumors < 5 mm was 3 for ECG-MDR-CT and 4 for MDR-CT. Mediastinal structures were better delineated by ECG-triggering. The median demarcation rating of the vessels and left bronchus was 2 for ECG-MDR-CT and 4 for MDR-CT. Detection rate and demarcation rating of pulmonary tumors and the delineation of mediastinal structures were not significant different for either CT technique. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates superiority for ECG-MDR-CT.
