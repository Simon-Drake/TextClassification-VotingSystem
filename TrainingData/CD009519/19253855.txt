[SPECT/CT fusion imaging for the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions in bones].
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the value of the single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) fusion imaging in the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions in bones. METHODS: One hundred and forty one bone lesions of 125 cancer patients, for whom the natures of the lesions were not able to be determined by the 99Tc(m)-MDP whole-body bone scan, were examined by the SPECT, CT and SPECT/CT fusion imaging simultaneously. All of the images were blindly interpreted independently by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. The natures of the lesions were eventually confirmed by MRI, pathology or follow-up diagnosis six months later. RESULTS: The diagnostic sensitivity of SPECT, SPECT+CT and SPECT/CT for the 141 bone lesions was 82.5%, 93.7%, and 98.4% respectively. The specificity was 66.7%, 80.8%, and 93.6% respectively. The accuracy was 73.8%, 86.5%, and 95.7% respectively. The specificity and accuracy of SPECT/CT for diagnosing bone lesions were significantly higher than those of SPECT and SPECT+CT (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: SPECT/CT can effectively differentiate benign and malignant bone lesions.
