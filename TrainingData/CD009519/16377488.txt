A case of pulmonary synovial sarcoma diagnosed with detection of chimera gene: imaging findings.
Pulmonary synovial sarcoma is a rare disease, and reports detailing clinicians' radiological findings are few. We report a case of a primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma in a 68-year-old woman. Chest CT revealed a well-defined and homogeneous oval mass measuring 3x2.5 cm in the left lower lobe in contact with the visceral pleura. No pleural effusion was evident. No calcification or fat component was detected. The tumor showed homogeneous hypointensity on both T1- and T2-weighted MR imaging. In this case, a lung metastasis could be excluded with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and the final diagnosis was histopathologically confirmed by the chimeric gene detection.
