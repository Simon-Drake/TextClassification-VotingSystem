[Detection by SPECT-CT scan with (99m)Tc-(V) DMSA of bone metastases in patient with medullary thyroid cancer].
Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, type 2B (MEN 2B), is a rare entity characterized by the presence of medullary thyroid cancer in 100% of the cases. The phenotype of this syndrome consists in the presence of marfanoid features and mucocutaneous neuromas. We describe the case of a male patient with MEN 2B syndrome who was diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer after lung metastases was found. We analyze the role of DMSA-V and the new hybrid SPECT-CT scan systems in the extension study and monitoring of medullary thyroid cancer.
