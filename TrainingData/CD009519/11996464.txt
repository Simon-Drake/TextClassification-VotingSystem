FDG-PET imaging in the management of non-small-cell lung cancer.
Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women in most Western countries. Tumour stage is the strongest prognostic factor and the most important parameter guiding treatment decision making. Metabolic positron emission tomography imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) has consistently proved superior to conventional imaging for staging of non-small-cell lung cancer and provides information of greater prognostic significance than can be obtained using conventional approaches. FDG-PET has been approved in the USA, Germany and the UK as a basic and invaluable tool in the management of lung cancer.
