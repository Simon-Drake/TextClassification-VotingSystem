[Schwannoma occurred in the right upper bronchial inlet; report of a case].
A 47-year-old woman was treated at a local hospital for obstructive pneumonia in February 2011. A computed tomography(CT)scan revealed a nodule obstructing the right upper bronchus. Histological diagnosis could not be established by biopsy under the bronchoscopic examination. She was referred to our hospital for further treatment. Since accumulation of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose(FDG)was noted by positron emission tomography(PET)[standardized uptake value(SUV)max 5.67/7.52], primary lung cancer was suspected and right upper sleeve lobectomy was performed. Pathology during surgery suggested the tumor to be schwannoma. Postoperative course was uneventful.
