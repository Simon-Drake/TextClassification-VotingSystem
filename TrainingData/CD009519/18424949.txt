Positron emission tomography/computed tomography and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging in staging of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer--initial results.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (wbMRI) in the correct staging of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients with an NSCLC stage IIIa or IIIb (36 males and 16 females) were included in this study. Patients were referred to our department for restaging. Within 1 week PET/CT and wbMRI were performed in all patients. Images were examined independently by 2 experienced physicians from the Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiology. Afterward, consensus reading was performed. In 22 patients, surgery served as gold standard, whereas in 30 patients, follow-up controls (after 2 months) were performed. RESULTS: The use of wbMRI correctly T-staged all patients. Especially volume interpolated breathhold examination sequence correctly T-staged all tumors. PET/CT did not correctly stage chest wall infiltration in 4 cases [sensitivity 92.3% (P < 0.05 to wbMRI)/specificity 100%], verified by surgery. PET/CT correctly N-staged 51 patients (sensitivity 96.1%/specificity 100%). WbMRI showed a significant tendency to understage N-status [sensitivity 88.5% (P < 0.05)/specificity 96.1%]. Different N-status by PET/CT changed operability in 4 patients. In 2 patients, distant metastases were detected by both techniques. CONCLUSION: In the correct staging of advanced NSCLC, PET/CT has advantages in N-staging. This is of high relevance for therapy planning. WbMRI especially using volume interpolated breathhold examination sequences, has certain advantages in T-staging.
