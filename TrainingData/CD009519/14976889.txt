[Study on glucose metabolic rate in non-small cell lung cancer patients with blood stasis syndrome and non-blood stasis syndrome].
OBJECTIVE: To study the difference of glucose metabolic rate in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with blood stasis syndrome and with non-blood stasis syndrome. METHODS: Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) and functional agent 2-[fluorine-18] fluorine-2-deoxy-glucose (18FDG) were used to detect the 18FDG uptake value in regions of interest (ROI) in tumor tissue of patients. RESULTS: In patients with same pathologic type, the maximum and mean standardized uptake value (Max SUV and Mean SUV) were significantly higher in the blood stasis group than those in the non-blood stasis group (P < 0.01); it also showed the same in patients with NSCLC of phase I, II and III (P < 0.05), but the 18FDG uptake rate was obviously enhanced in patients of phase IV (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The glucose uptake in NSCLC patients of blood stasis syndrome was higher than that in those with of non-blood stasis syndrome.
