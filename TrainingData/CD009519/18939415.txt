[Case of metastatic germ cell tumor with testicular calcification detected by MD-CT].
Metastasis of testicular germ cell tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis when young male patient have multiple pulmonary metastases. However burned-out tumors cannot be easily detected on inspection and palpation of the testis. A 19 year-old man visited to our hospital complaining of anorexia, weight loss and dyspnea. Chest X-ray films showed multiple lung nodules. Physical examination revealed gynecomastia, and many cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes with a diameter of 1 cm were palpable. Physical examination of testis revealed no laterality. Multi-detector CT showed multiple lung nodules, a hepatic and a retroperitoneal large mass and a tiny calcification in the right testis. Histological findings of the lung obtained by percutaneous biopsy and the presence of a calcification in the testis led to a diagnosis of testicular choriocarcinoma showing burned-out tumor. However there was no previous report of burned-out tumor detected by CT, MD-CT including that of the testis was valuable at the first diagnostic stage when germ cell tumor was suspected.
