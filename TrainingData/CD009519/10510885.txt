Axillary lymph node uptake of Tc-99m MIBI resulting from extravasation should not be misinterpreted as metastasis.
Ipsilateral axillary lymph node visualization due to extravasation of Tc-99m MDP intravenous injection has been well documented. A patient with suspected angina underwent Tc-99m MIBI myocardial SPECT who had extravasation of Tc-99m MIBI in the antecubital region resulting in ipsilateral axillary lymph node uptake. This finding should not be misinterpreted as lymphatic nodal metastasis in a patient with breast cancer or lung cancer.
