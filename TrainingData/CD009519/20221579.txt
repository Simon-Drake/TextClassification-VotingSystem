[Combined functional and morphological imaging of sarcomas: significance for diagnostics and therapy monitoring].
(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) and especially hybrid FDG-PET/CT is becoming more and more accepted for the clinical management of adult and pediatric patients with sarcomas. By integrating the CT component the specificity in particular but also the sensitivity of the modality are improved further. With PET/CT a complete staging including the detection of lung metastases is feasible in a single examination. For patients with primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas FDG-PET/CT is utilized for diagnosis, staging and restaging, metabolic tumor grading, guidance of biopsies, detection of tumor recurrence and therapy monitoring. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that FDG uptake of the tumor prior to treatment and changes of FDG uptake after therapy significantly correlate with histopathologic response and survival of patients. Therefore, PET and PET/CT have a prognostic value. In the future new perspectives of hybrid PET/CT imaging will arise by introducing novel radiotracers and combined functional imaging of tumor metabolism and perfusion. High resolution MRI is essential for local evaluation of the primary tumor and preoperative planning with assessment of possible infiltration of vascular or neural structures. Contrast-enhanced MRI remains a key tool in the diagnosis of recurrent disease, especially in tumors which are not hypermetabolic. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR sequences can significantly contribute to therapy monitoring. More research is necessary to prospectively compare dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and FDG-PET/CT for evaluation of local and recurrent diseases.
