[Value of integrated positron-emission tomography and computed tomography in gross tumor volume delineation for radiotherapy for bone metastasis].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of integrated positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) in gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for bone metastasis. METHODS: Three patients with multiple bone metastases were enrolled in this study, whose primary tumors were pathologically identified as lung cancer, liver cancer and renal cell carcinoma. In each case, 6 sites of bone metastases were selected, labeled as BM1 to BM6 which located in the lumbar, thoracic vertebra, rib, ilium, scapula and thighbone respectively. The GTVs of the 6 bone metastases were delineated on the CT scans for treatment planning by 8 radiation oncologists, and the results were compared with the delineation obtained on the basis of integrated CT and PET/CT for analyzing the interobserver variability. RESULTS: For BM1-5 with obvious bone cortex lesions by the carcinoma, the GTV delineated on the basis of CT was greater than that derived from PET/CT (P<0.05), whereas for BM6 with intact bone cortex, the contrary result was observed (P<0.05). For any of these bone metastasis, the interobserver variability in GTV delineation with PET/CT was less than that with CT. CONCLUSION: PET/CT is useful for improving the accuracy of GTV delineation for the protection of the normal tissues during radiotherapy.
