Spontaneous regression of lung adenocarcinoma: Report of a case.
This report presents a rare case of lung adenocarcinoma accompanied by partial spontaneous regression (SR). A 69-year-old woman with an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray was admitted to the hospital. She was diagnosed to have lung adenocarcinoma with right adrenal metastasis based on a thorough examination. However, a month after the diagnosis, the primary and metastatic lesions markedly shrank on the following computed tomography scan and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomograph. This was thought to be a partial SR of the cancer, and she was treated with a surgical procedure. She has since remained free of disease for 14 months after the surgery.
