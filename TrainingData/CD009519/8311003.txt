Positron emission tomography diagnosis of pulmonary metastases in osteogenic sarcoma.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging technique that can produce high-quality tomographic images reflective of the metabolic characteristics of imaged tissue. Among the many positron-emitting tracers utilized in conjunction with PET is [18F]fluoride ion; it is actively taken up in bone in proportion to bone metabolic activity, analogous to standard nuclear medicine bone scanning agents such as technetium methylenediphosphonate ([99mTc]MDP). Whole-body imaging with PET and [18F]fluoride ion generates tomographic images that are useful in mapping patterns of bone metabolism, as well as identifying extraosseous site of bone formation or calcification. We report the case of a patient with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, metastatic osteogenic sarcoma, and a breast mass, who presented with pulmonary nodules, in whom [18F] fluoride ion/PET imaging was useful in confirming the nature of the pulmonary nodules.
