Distant metastasis of prostate cancer: early detection of recurrent tumor with dual-phase carbon-11 choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in two cases.
Several types of recurrence may be detected by radiologic assessment after treatment in patients with prostate cancer. However, early detection of distant metastasis using positron emission tomography has so far never been published. We report two patients who underwent hormone therapy or surgical resection for prostate cancer. They developed distant metastases which were detected on whole body [C-11] choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography with significant elevation of serum PSA level. In one patient, recurrent tumor of the supraclavicular node (6 mm) diminished in size after subsequent hormone therapy. Surgical resection of recurrent tumor of the lung (12 mm) was performed in the other patient, the pathology of which confirmed the metastatic adenocarcinoma derived from the prostate. The recurrent tumor can be correctly detected by dual-phase whole body [C-11] choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography.
