Epithelial-directed drug delivery: influence of formulation and delivery devices.
Technology to deliver drugs reliable throughout the entire respiratory tract has greatly improved in part because of asthma- and infectious disease-related applications. Recent improvements with spiral CT technology applied to detect early lung cancer in high risk populations have also enhanced the prospect of finding locally confined primary lung cancers. In this setting, the need to safely and economically manage the local regional phase of early lung cancer is assuming great strategic importance. At the same time the growing knowledge regarding the molecular and biochemical events driving the progression of lung cancer is allowing the development of targeted drug that may be useful in arresting lung cancer progression. The questions considered in this forum is whether improvements in these areas are sufficiently mature to allow application of local regional drug delivery with targeted drug agents to improve the management of early lung cancer.
