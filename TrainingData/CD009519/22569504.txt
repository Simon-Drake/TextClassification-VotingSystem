[Metastatic lung tumor from colon cancer with cavitation: report of a case].
A 55-year-old man underwent rectal amputation for rectal cancer in August 2005. A tiny thin-walled cavity lesion in his left S1+2 was found on computed tomography (CT) of the chest in November 2008. The cavity lesion in the left S1+2 gradually increased in size over 3 months and positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) showed FDG accumulation at the lesion. Videoassisted thoracoscopic (VATS) wedge resection was performed to make a definite diagnosis in March 2009. The pathological findings revealed a metastatic lung tumor from the rectal cancer. It is necessary to consider the possibility of metastatic lung tumors in a case with the cavity lesions especially in patients with a history of colon cancer.
