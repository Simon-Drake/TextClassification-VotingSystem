Multiple endocrine neoplasia with pulmonary localization: a new protocol of approach.
We present three patients with bronchial carcinoids, in which a more probed study emphasized the presence of three multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). Assessment included a total-body computerized tomography, a total-body single-photon emission computerized tomography by 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1 octreotide, and genetic map. Two patients presented an atypical MEN 1 and one patient showed an atypical MEN 1 with a familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. All patients were operated upon: two are still alive and one died 50 months after the first intervention. Precocious diagnosis of MEN permits a good long-term outcome.
