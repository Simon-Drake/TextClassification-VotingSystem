Efficacy of mediastinal lymph node dissection during lobectomy for lung cancer by thoracoscopy and thoracotomy.
BACKGROUND: Mediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND) is an integral component of complete resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study analyzed the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's (NCCN) NSCLC Database to compare the efficacy of MLND during lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy (open). METHODS: The NCCN NSCLC Database was queried to identify patients who underwent lobectomy to analyze the adequacy of MLND by the number of LN stations. The percentage of patients with at least three N2 stations, the number of N2 LN stations, and the total number of LN stations (N1+N2) resected was compared by approach. RESULTS: Of 4215 patients with NSCLC (January 2007 to September 2010), 388 patients underwent lobectomy (199 VATS and 189 open) and met entry criteria. The groups were similar in age, sex, comorbidities, performance status, and histology. MLN assessment was similar in both groups as measured by number of N2 stations (median, 3 stations; p=0.12). At least three MLN stations were assessed in 130 patients (66%) in the VATS group vs 107 patients (58%) in the open group (p=0.12). The total number of N1+N2 stations resected for each group was also similar (median, 4 in both groups (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The NCCN database indicates at least three MLN stations were assessed in most patients who underwent lobectomy by either approach. As evaluated by the number of LN stations, there was no difference in the efficacy of MLN dissection by approach.
