PET scan-CT correlation: what the chest radiologist needs to know.
The purpose of this article is to familiarize the chest radiologist with the basics of PET scanning in the chest and to correlate PET findings with thoracic CT findings. After completing this article, the reader should know the following: (a) how PET scanning is performed; (b) the indications for PET scanning in the chest; (c) the significance of SUV and a positive test; (c) the causes of false-positive and false-negative PET scans; and (d) the importance of correlating PET findings with Chest CT findings. The authors conclude that PET and chest CT studies should be read in conjunction to optimize diagnostic accuracy. Interpreting either study alone is fraught with errors, while combined interpretations yield information on both functional activity and anatomic localization. PET-CT hybrid devices that fuse PET and CT data simplify this task and fusion imaging is rapidly becoming the test of choice for evaluating thoracic malignancies.
