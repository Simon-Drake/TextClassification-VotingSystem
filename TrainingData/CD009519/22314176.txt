[Rectal metastasis from lung cancer; report of a case].
A 70-year-old male underwent left pneumonectomy for lung cancer in November 2008. Although he was diagnosed as pT2bN1M0 (stage II B) after the operation, adrenal metastasis was found 8 months later. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed accumulation in the adrenal gland and rectum. Gastrointestinal tract examination revealed a type 1 tumor in the rectum. Histological examination of biopsy specimens obtained from the lesion suggested papillary adenocarcinoma of rectum. Abdominoperineal resection was performed. The resected rectal tumor was reported immunohistochemically as metastasis from primary lung cancer.
