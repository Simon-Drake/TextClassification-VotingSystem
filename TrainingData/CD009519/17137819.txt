[Positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in the management of nonsmall cell lung cancers in 2006].
Technological progress and numerous published studies allow to estimate the best place of the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, a real functional metabolic imagery, in the clinical and therapeutic strategy of non small cell lung cancers.
