[A case of bilateral 3-lung lesion (metastatic and primary tumour, tumourlet) resected simultaneously].
A 70-year-old male patient underwent right nephrectomy for renal clear cell carcinoma. After 8 years an X-ray showed a nodule on the left lung, and CT scan detected it to be a 15 x 12 mm mass in S1+2 segment of the left lung. CT also detected another 15 x 7 mm mass in the right S3 segment. These lesions had a high FDG accumulation. Pre-operative diagnosis is bilateral pulmonary metastases from renal cell carcinoma, and bilateral lung segmentectomy was performed. Left S1+2 resected tumor was histologically clear cell carcinoma by intra-operative examination, then right S3 segmentectomy was done. And that time, small tumor was found in the middle lung lobe, and a wedge resection was performed. These specimens revealed a primary lung carcinoma of right S3, and tumourlet of middle lobe. It is very rare that three different histlogical types of lung tumor were found.
