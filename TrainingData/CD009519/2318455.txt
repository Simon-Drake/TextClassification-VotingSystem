Radioimmunodetection of uterine leiomyosarcoma with 111In-labeled monoclonal antimyosin antibody Fab fragments.
Radioimmunodetection of uterine leiomyosarcoma in a 64-year-old woman with a palpable local recurrence is described. Pathological abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic accumulation of monoclonal 111In-labeled antimyosin was observed. Afterward, these lesions were examined by whole-body X-ray computed tomography. With a double-tracer technique (pulmonary and hepatic/splenic subtractions) the lesions were delineated better and SPECT (radioisotope tomography) was used for more accurate localization of the abdominal and pelvic lesions. These findings indicate that antimyosin scintigraphy might be useful in staging and follow-up of uterine leiomyosarcoma.
