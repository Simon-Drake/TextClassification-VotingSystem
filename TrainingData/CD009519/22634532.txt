Clinical study on the recombinant human endostatin regarding improving the blood perfusion and hypoxia of non-small-cell lung cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To observe the dynamic changes of blood perfusion and hypoxic status with CT perfusion imaging and hypoxia imaging in patients of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with recombinant human endostatin (RHES). METHODS: Fifteen previously untreated patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC were enrolled. They were randomly divided into research group (n=10) and negative control group (n=5). The patients of the research group continuously used RHES for ten days, and simultaneously had CT perfusion imaging and hypoxia imaging performed on days 1, 5 and 10, respectively. The remaining 5(control) only had CT perfusion imaging and hypoxia imaging, without using RHES, on days 1, 5 and 10, respectively. According to the above results, we could obtain a "time window" during which RHES improves blood perfusion and hypoxia of lung cancer. RESULTS: In the research group, after using RHES, capillary permeability surface (PS) and tumour to normal tissue (T/N) decreased at first, and then increased. Their lowest points occurred on about the fifth day with statistical significance compared with the first day (T/N, p=0.00; PS, p<0.01). Blood flow (BF) was first increased and then decreased. Its highest point occurred on about the fifth day with statistical significance compared with the first and tenth day (all p<0.01). The PS, BF and T/N peaked on the fifth day in the research group with statistical significance compared with the negative control group as well (all p<0.01). The above results suggested that RHES's "time window" was within about one week after administration. CONCLUSION: RHES's "time window" is within about one week after administration, which provides an important experimental basis for combining RHES with radiotherapy in human tumours.
