[Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration in pulmonary medicine].
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration has significantly increased the capacity of pulmonary diagnostic procedures. Since this method was introduced, 1212 examinations have been performed at two centres of pulmonary medicine. Data on indications, procedures, findings, diagnostic yield and complications have been recorded. This paper describes the experiences thus gained regarding the possibilities and limitations of the method and assesses the current significance of the technique in pulmonary medicine according to previous studies. In primary diagnosis of mediastinal tissue alterations and in staging of malignant diseases the method offers a low-complication diagnostic measure which has a seminal impact on therapy in many cases, even though in daily practise the diagnostic accuracy of published studies is not always attained.
