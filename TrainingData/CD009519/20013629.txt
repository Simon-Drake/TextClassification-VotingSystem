A pulmonary sclerosing hemagioma with an increasing uptake on PET.
Pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma is a relatively rare neoplasm of the lung. Although there have been five previous case reports that address the 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) findings in a sclerosing hemangioma of the lung, no report has demonstrated an interval change in the FDG-PET findings. This report describes a case of pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma which presented with an increase of uptake of FDG-PET after about one years' follow-up.
