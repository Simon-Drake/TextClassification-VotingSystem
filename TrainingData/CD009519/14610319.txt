Technetium-99m tetrofosmin SPECT predicts chemotherapy response in small cell lung cancer.
The multidrug resistance gene 1 encoding human P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is thought to play an important role in the multidrug resistance of lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to predict chemotherapy response by technetium-99m tetrofosmin (Tc-99m TF) lung single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and compare Pgp expression in patients with untreated small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Forty patients with untreated SCLC received Tc-99m TF lung SPECT prior to chemotherapy. The chemotherapy response was evaluated in the 3rd month after completion of treatment. Immunohistochemical staining of Pgp expression was performed on multiple nonconsecutive sections of biopsy specimens. By quantitative analyses, tumor to background ratios were 1.86 +/- 0.27 and 1.17 +/- 0.26 for patients with a good and poor response, respectively (p < 0.05). All of the 20 patients with a good chemotherapy response also had a positive Tc-99m TF lung SPECT and negative Pgp expression. In contrast, only 4 of the 20 patients with a poor chemotherapy response had a positive Tc-99m TF lung SPECT. Moreover, 10 of the 20 patients with a poor chemotherapy response also had negative Pgp expression (p < 0.05). Therefore, we concluded that Tc-99m TF lung SPECT can accurately predict the chemotherapy response, and Tc-99m TF lung SPECT findings can be partially compatible with Pgp expression in patients with untreated SCLC.
