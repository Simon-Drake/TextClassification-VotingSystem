Conversion from FDG-negative to -positive during follow-up in a rare case of pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.
A female patient aged 75 years presented with an incidental pulmonary nodule without FDG uptake when undergoing FDG PET/CT. Without obtaining histologic diagnosis, the follow-up FDG PET/CT 2 years later demonstrated intense FDG avidity within previously FDG-negative tumor. After surgery, the pathologic diagnosis is pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC). LELCs are unique because of histologic similarities with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma and with a better prognosis as compared with other lung malignancies. However, the expression of FDG uptake in LELC has never been discussed. Herein, we describe a pulmonary LELC manifesting as a slowly growing tumor displaying conversion from FDG-negative to -positive avidity.
