Application of subsecond rotation scan to helical CT for lung cancer screening.
PURPOSE: To clarify whether the benefit of a reduced effective scan width obtained using a smaller pitch outweighs the disadvantage of increased noise in the application of a subsecond helical CT to mass screenings for lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two helical CT scans of the lung were obtained in 11 healthy subjects using the following parameters: 1) scan 1 was performed at 120 kVp, 50 mA, 10-mm collimation, 1-second/rotation, helical pitch of 2.0; and 2) scan 2 was performed at 120 kVp, 50 mA, 10-mm collimation, 0.75-second/rotation, helical pitch of 1.5. Computer-generated nodules measuring 10 mm and 6 mm in diameter showing ground-glass opacity were superimposed on these images. The detectability of each nodule was evaluated by six blinded readers using ROC analysis. RESULTS: Detectability of the 6-mm nodules was significantly higher in scan 2 than in scan 1. Detectability of the 10-mm nodules was not significantly different between scans 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: The use of a smaller pitch by employing a subsecond rotation scan in a helical CT for lung cancer screenings improves the detection of small lesions without increasing either the scanning time or radiation dose.
