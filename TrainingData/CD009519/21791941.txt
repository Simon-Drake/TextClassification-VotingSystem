Additional lesions detected in therapeutic scans with 177Lu-DOTATATE reflect higher affinity of 177Lu-DOTATATE for somatostatin receptors.
OBJECTIVE: Peptide receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy (PRRT) of somatostatin receptor (SR)-expressing neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) has become an established therapeutic option in patients with advanced NETs. The aim of this study was to compare the lesion detection rate of (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC, a newly developed tracer for NET imaging, with (177)Lu-DOTATATE used for PRRT. METHODS: 8 patients (4 women, 4 men, age range 46-76 years) with histologically proven NETs, who showed high SR loads by (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy, were treated with (177)Lu-DOTATATE. After treatment, all patients were subjected to whole-body scintigraphy with additional low-dose single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) of the chest and abdomen. RESULTS: All patients demonstrated (177)Lu-DOTATATE accumulation in all lesions previously detected by (99m)Tc- EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy. Three patients showed additional lesions in the liver and lungs. CONCLUSIONS: SPECT-CT after (177)Lu-DOTATATE therapy may be helpful in detecting additional lesions not seen using (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. This could reflect the broader affinity of (177)Lu-DOTATATE for SRs compared with (99m)Tc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC.
