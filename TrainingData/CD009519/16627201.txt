PET and planar imaging of tumor hypoxia with labeled metronidazole.
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to develop 99mTc- and 68Ga-labeled metronidazole (MN) using ethylenedicysteine (EC) as a chelator and evaluate their potential use to assess tumor hypoxia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EC-MN was labeled with 99mTc in the presence of tin (II) chloride. Labeling EC-MN with 68Ga was achieved by adding 68GaCl3 (2 mCi with 3.4 microg cold GaCl3). In vitro cellular uptakes of 99mTc- and 68Ga-EC-MN were obtained in various types of tumor cells at 0.5-4 hours. Tissue distribution and PET imaging of 99mTc and 68Ga-EC-MN were evaluated in breast tumor-bearing rats at 0.5-4 hours. Tumor oxygen tension was measured using an oxygen probe. RESULTS: There were similar cellular uptakes (2-10%) between 99mTc- and 68Ga-EC-MN at 0.5-4 hours. In vivo biodistribution of 99mTc- and 68Ga-EC-MN in breast tumor-bearing rats showed increased tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle count density ratios as a function of time. Positron emission tomography images confirmed that the tumors could be visualized clearly with 68Ga-EC-MN. Oxygen tension in tumor tissue was determined to be 6-10 mm Hg compared with 40-50 mm Hg in normal muscle tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that it is feasible to use 99mTc- and 68Ga-EC-MN for assessment of tumor hypoxia. These agents may be useful in selecting and evaluating cancer therapy.
