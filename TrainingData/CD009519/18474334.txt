MR imaging in diagnosis and staging of pulmonary carcinoma.
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death for men and women in the United States. Accurate cancer staging is essential for determining appropriate management and predicting prognosis. CT, along with positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose, currently is the main imaging modality for staging lung cancer. The role of MR imaging is limited, although improvements in MR imaging technology and contrast media potentially will make MR imaging a viable ionizing-radiation-free alternative.
