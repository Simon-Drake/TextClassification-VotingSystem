Fluoro-deoxi-glucose uptake and angiogenesis are independent biological features in lung metastases.
Neoangiogenesis and enhanced glucose metabolism in neoplasms are likely to be activated by the same biochemical stimulus; hypoxia. A correlation between these two parameters has been postulated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between Fluoro-desoxi-glucose uptake at positron emission tomography scan and angiogenesis in lung metastasis. Fluoro-desoxi-glucose activity, expressed as a standard uptake value, and microvessel intratumoural density, were retrospectively calculated in a series of 43 lung metastasis resected in 19 patients. Primary sites were colorectal cancer in 16 metastases, sarcoma in eight, gynaecological in four and other sites in 15. The correlation between the two parameters was tested by logistic regression and multivariate analysis. Positron emission tomography scan was positive in 17 patients (sensitivity 89%). No correlation was observed between standard uptake value and microvessel intratumoural density in this series of lung metastasis. Positron emission tomography negative and positive nodules presented comparable value of microvessel intratumoural density (12.9 vs 11.3). Standard uptake value was significantly correlated with nodules size and was higher in colon cancer metastasis than in sarcoma ones. Microvessel intratumoural density was independent from nodule size but significantly higher in sarcoma than in colon cancer metastasis. The lack of correlation was confirmed by multivariate analysis after adjustment for tumour type and nodules size. The present study demonstrated that positron emission tomography scan is positive in a high proportion of patients regardless of microvessel density. Glucose uptake and angiogenesis appear to be independent biological features in lung metastasis. This observation may have implications for future antiangiogenic therapies.
