[Abdominal lymph node metastases detected five years after surgery for the lung cancer; report of a case].
A 73-year-old woman who had underwent right lower lobectomy for adenocarcinoma of the lung( S10,pT1aN0M0, stage I A) 5 years before, visited our hospital with back pain. Whole body computed tomography (CT) revealed the enlargement of the abodominal lymph nodes surrounding the celiac artery,which was positive for fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography( FDG-PET). Open biopsy of the lymph node was performed and histopathological diagnosis was metastases of adenocarcinoma.Additional immunohistological examination showed positive findings for cytokeratin( CK) 7 and thyroid transcription factor( TTF)-1, but negative for CK20, suggesting the lesion to be metastases of lung cancer. Abdominal lymph node should be kept in mind in patients with lower lobe lung cancer.
