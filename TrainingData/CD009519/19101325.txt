Coiling of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries with agenesis of the left pulmonary artery prior to pneumonectomy.
The case of a patient with a left upper lobe lung tumor and unilateral agenesis of the left pulmonary artery with multiple aortopulmonary collaterals is discussed. Preoperative angiographic localization with embolization of the dominant multiple aortopulmonary collaterals allowed pneumonectomy to be performed safely with acceptable blood loss.
