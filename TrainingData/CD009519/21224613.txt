[A case of metastasis to the stomach from primary adenocarcinoma of the lung cancer].
We report a case of gastric metastasis of lung cancer performed gastrectomy for the primary foci. A 70s woman was diagnosed as having right lung cancer and underwent right lower lobectomy and lymph node dissection. The histological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma (pT4, N2, M0). Four years later, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT revealed a tumor in the stomach and para-aortic lymph nodes swelling. The submucosal tumor was showed in the cardia by endoscopic examination. Biopsy showed a papillary adenocarcinoma. With the diagnosis of gastric metastasis from lung cancer, she was operated on. A proximal gastrectomy was carried out. The histopathological examination demonstrated papillary adenocarcinoma similar to that of the lung cancer with lymph node metastasis. No postoperative complications occurred and she was discharged from the hospital. Since then, she was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy as an outpatient.
