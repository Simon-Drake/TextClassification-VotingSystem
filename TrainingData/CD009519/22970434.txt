Unilateral adrenal metastasis from non-small-cell lung cancer demonstrating very high FDG uptake with a standardized uptake value in excess of sixty.
We report the case of a 52-year-old man who presented with a 2-week history of dyspnea and wheeze. CT scan of the chest showed a large soft-tissue lesion in the right main bronchus extending into the trachea. Pathologic examination of endoscopic tracheal biopsies showed features consistent with a non-small-cell lung carcinoma. 18F-FDG PET/CT showed very high uptake of FDG in the bronchial tumor (high standardized uptake values: 25.1) and unexpected very intense uptake in the left adrenal gland (high standardized uptake values: 62.5). Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed, and subsequent histopathological examination confirmed metastatic non-small-cell carcinoma in the adrenal gland. Although adrenal malignancies are generally metabolically active, such high uptake of FDG within a metastatic lesion has not been reported previously.
