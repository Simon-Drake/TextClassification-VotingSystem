[PET/CT in radiotherapy].
Combining positron emission tomography (PET) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) with simultaneous acquisition may improve diagnostic accuracy in oncology. Moreover this combination holds considerable promise in radiotherapy. Metabolic information may be used in decision making in radiotherapy and in planning target volumes. Furthermore early evaluation of treatment efficacy becomes possible. New tracers for the assessment of tumour hypoxia or apoptosis in clinical routine are currently being developed. These tracers may yield high relevance in radiotherapy. Hybrid scanners facilitate patient handling and shorten the duration of acquisition. Furthermore fusion accuracy is optimal. Prospective studies have to be conducted to show that the new technology improves patient care in terms of efficiency and quality.
