Isolated asymptomatic skeletal muscle metastasis in a potentially resectable non-small cell lung cancer: detection with FDG PET-CT scanning.
Asymptomatic skeletal muscle metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer is a rare event particularly when it is detected at initial staging. This report describes how whole body imaging with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) detected a solitary asymptomatic metastasis to the gluteus maximus muscle in a potentially resectable case of non-small cell lung cancer, thereby changing the treatment plan from surgical resection to systemic chemotherapy.
