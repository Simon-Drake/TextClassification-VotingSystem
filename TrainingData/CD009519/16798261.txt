Radiofrequency ablation of lung malignancies.
Radiofrequency ablation is a new technology that has been used successfully to treat hepatic tumors. Recently, an increasing number of reports have described the use of radiofrequency ablation for primary and metastatic lung tumors. Although such early experience appears promising, many questions regarding patient selection, radiofrequency ablation technique, effectiveness of ablation on lung tumors, radiographic follow-up, and survival remain unanswered. This article addresses these issues and provides the thoracic surgeon with a current review of the application of radiofrequency ablation to lung tumors.
