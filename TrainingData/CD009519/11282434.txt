Basaloid large cell lung carcinoma presenting concurrently with metastatic uveal tumor.
A 51-year-old man complaining of cough, hemoptysis, and decreased visual acuity was admitted to our hospital. Chest radiography revealed a left hilar mass and pleural effusion in the left hemithorax. In his ophtalmological examination, there was total retinal detachment in the left eye. Ultrasonographic examination and orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were reported as choroidal metastasis. A computed tomography (CT) confirmed the mass in the left hilum and multiple mass lesions consistent with metastasis in the liver and in the body of 12th thoracic vertebra. Bronchoscopic biopsies revealed large cell carcinoma with basaloid features. He died after 4 months with rapid progression of the disease in spite of combined chemotherapy. Although primary lung cancer with concurrent eye metastasis is an uncommon entity, it should always be kept in mind for patients with ocular symptoms.
