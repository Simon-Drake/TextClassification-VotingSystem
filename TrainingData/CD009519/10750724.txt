Positron emission tomography in initial staging and diagnosis of persistent or recurrent disease.
Positron emission tomography (PET) constitutes a major advance in the diagnosis, staging, prognostic assessment, and follow-up of lung cancer. However, it is not a magic bullet that can solve all of the uncertainties that beguile the imaging of this disease. Small lesions, particularly those in the brain, may often be missed with PET, and three-dimensional localization of suspected sites may also be unreliable. We are still learning how best to apply this new technology in an environment that demands the efficient use of medical resources. PET will probably be used most enthusiastically in the prethoracotomy staging of patients who are considered operable or probably operable on the basis of computed tomography and in the assessment of treatment response and disease recurrence when clinical management will be determined by prompt recognition of these events.
