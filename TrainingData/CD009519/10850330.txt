Status of scintimammography and its relationship to other detection methods for breast cancer.
Breast cancer is the most important malignancy for women of the world's industrialized nations. It is second only to lung cancer in cancer-related mortality. Early detection is the best means of improving survival; the cornerstone of early diagnosis is mammography. Given the endemic nature of breast cancer, screening mammography has secured a routine place in health maintenance for women, although it is less than perfect. To aid in the diagnosis of malignant breast disease, other imaging modalities have evolved: ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and SMM. Scintimammography (SMM) is rapidly with a variety of applications for the management of breast disease. This technology has become a complementary modality to other conventional methods of breast imaging. This review will focus on the science behind SMM and how it is currently used in the management of breast lesions.
