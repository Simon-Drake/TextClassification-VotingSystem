Intramuscular metastasis of carcinoid tumor: a rare manifestation.
A 43-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of left upper lobectomy due to an atypical lung carcinoid tumor. The patient was referred to our department for further evaluation. An In-111 octreotide (Octreoscan) whole body scan and single photon emission computed tomography were performed. The scans showed slightly increased diffused tracer uptake in the apex of the left lung, most probably due to postoperative changes. A focal area of increased uptake in the right lower abdomen was also noted. Fusing octreotide tomographic construction with CT images allowed accurate determination of the area of increased uptake to be in the right transverse abdominal muscle.
