Protection of lung function by introducing single photon emission computed tomography lung perfusion image into radiotherapy plan of lung cancer.
BACKGROUND: The lung functional status could be displayed on lung perfusion images. With the images, the radiotherapy plans of lung cancer could be guided to more optimized. This study aimed to assess quantitatively the impact of incorporating functional lung imaging into 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Ten patients with NSCLC who had undergone radiotherapy were included in this study. Before radiotherapy, each patient underwent CT simulation and lung perfusion imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The SPECT images were registered with simulation planning CT and used to contour functional lung (lung-F) and non-functional lung (lung-NF). Two 3DCRT plans and two IMRT plans were designed and compared in each patient: two anatomic plans using simulation CT alone and two functional plans using SPECT-CT in addition to the simulation CT. Dosimetric parameters of the four types of plans were compared in terms of tumor coverage and avoidance of normal tissues. Total radiation dose was set at 66 Gy (2 Gy x 33 fractions). RESULTS: In incorporating perfusion information in 3DCRT and IMRT planning, the reductions on average in the mean doses to the functional lung in the functional plan were 168 cGy and 89 cGy, respectively, compared with those in the anatomic plans. The median reductions in the percentage of volume irradiated with > 5 Gy, > 10 Gy, > 20 Gy, > 30 Gy and > 40 Gy for functional lung in the functional plans were 6.50%, 10.21%, 14.02%, 22.30% and 23.46% in 3DCRT planning, respectively, and 3.05%, 15.52%, 14.16%, 4.87%, and 3.33% in IMRT planning, respectively. No greater degree of sparing of the functional lung was achieved in functional IMRT than in 3DCRT. CONCLUSION: Function-guided 3DCRT and IMRT plannings both appear to be effective in preserving functional lung in NSCLC patients.
