Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography excludes pericardial metastasis by recurrent lung cancer.
Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis and staging of a variety of malignancies. Because of its high sensitivity, FDG PET frequently detects malignant lesions that are not demonstrated clearly by anatomic imaging modalities. FDG PET usually has high negative predictive value and, therefore, negative studies are highly suggestive of a benign process. The authors present a patient in whom transesophageal echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging described pericardial metastasis from a recurrent lung cancer, which on FDG PET was shown correctly to suggest benign scar tissue.
