[Imaging strategy for staging and follow-up of endocrine tumors].
Endocrine tumours constitute a homogeneous network of tumours scattered in the body and characterized by several common features including their capacity to secrete hormones, their association as part of inherited syndrome and their ability to be explored either by functioning imaging than by morphological imaging. However, they have a broad and initially misleading clinical spectrum. Staging of these tumours must be multidisciplinary with the association of primary tumour exploration, staging and follow-up. It also contribute to the screening of complications due to hormonal secretions, the exploration of inherited syndromes and a second cancer diagnosis. First we review the technical characteristics of each imaging modality including morphological imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), metabolic imaging (somatostatin receptors scintigraphy, PET-scan), endoscopy and vascular imaging. Then we review for each endocrine tumour localization and clinical presentation, the imaging strategy as well as the most common morphological and functional features.
