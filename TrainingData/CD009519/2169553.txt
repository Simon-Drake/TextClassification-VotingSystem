[201T1 single photon emission computed tomography in the diagnosis of lung cancer].
201T1 SPECT was performed in 84 patients with suspected lung cancer. Both early and delayed scans demonstrated abnormal accumulation in 67 of 68 malignant pulmonary lesions and in nine of 18 benign conditions. All of 64 lung cancer were clearly visualized. Delayed ratio (uptake ratio of the lesion to the normal lung on delayed scan) and retention index (degree of retention in the lesion) were helpful to differentiate malignant from benign lesions. This method was also useful to evaluate mediastinal involvement from lung cancer.
