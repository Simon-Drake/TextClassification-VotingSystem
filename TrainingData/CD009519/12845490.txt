Clinical usefulness of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy in oncological diagnostics: a preliminary communication.
This study assessed the clinical usefulness of a new technetium-99m labelled somatostatin analogue from the standpoint of oncological diagnostics. The study group comprised 40 patients in whom malignant neoplasms (32 primary and 8 metastatic) had been diagnosed. Among the primary tumours there were 21 cases of lung cancer (2 small cell and 19 non-small cell), seven pituitary adenomas (five hormonally active and two inactive), one liposarcoma, two carcinoids and one breast carcinoma. The metastatic tumours consisted of three malignant melanomas, one phaeochromocytoma, one prostatic cancer, one leiomyosarcoma, one pancreatic carcinoma ectopically secreting ACTH and one carcinoid of the thymus. The radiopharmaceutical 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-Tyr3-octreotide was administered i.v. at an activity of 740-925 MBq. The imaging comprised a whole-body scan and a single-photon emission tomography acquisition. Positive scintigrams were obtained in all cases of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, four out of five hormonally active pituitary adenomas, one out of two cases of carcinoid, the liposarcoma and the breast cancer. Neoplastic metastases were visualised in two out of three patients with melanoma and in patients with phaeochromocytoma, ACTH-secreting pancreatic carcinoma and thymic carcinoid. Scintigrams were negative in both hormonally inactive pituitary adenomas, in one case of metastatic malignant melanoma, in the leiomyosarcoma and in the case of metastasis from prostatic carcinoma. The results of this pilot study indicate that 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC is a potentially useful radiopharmaceutical for imaging of a wide range of primary and metastatic tumours. Special attention should be paid to the successful imaging of all cases of non-small cell lung cancer.
