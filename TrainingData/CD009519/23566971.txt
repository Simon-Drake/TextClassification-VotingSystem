Performance of integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography for mediastinal nodal staging in non-small cell lung carcinoma.
Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is routinely used for mediastinal nodal staging of non-small cell lung carcinoma in centers throughout the world. This modality is the most accurate noninvasive means by which to identify metastatic disease in mediastinal lymph nodes. This article reviews the evidence supporting the use of PET/CT and discusses the clinical applicability of this modality.
