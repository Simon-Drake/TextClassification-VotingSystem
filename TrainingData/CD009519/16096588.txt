Patients with known or suspected lung cancer: evaluation of clinical management changes due to 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) study.
AIM: To determine prospectively from the referring physician's point of view the impact of F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-FDG PET) results on the management decisions in patients with known or suspected lung cancer. METHODS: Seventy-five consecutive patients (58 men, 17 women; age range, 33-82 years; mean age, 64 years) with a diagnosis of a pulmonary lesion, obtained by means of morphological imaging studies and/or cytological sampling, were included in the study. The patient population consisted of three groups: (A) patients (n=18) with a solitary lung nodule; (B) patients (n=37) with untreated lung cancer; and (C) patients (n=20) with treated lung cancer. All were referred for whole-body F-FDG PET within 15 days (mean, 11 days) of lung lesion detection. To determine whether and how PET findings could modify the treatment strategy, a questionnaire was sent to the referring physician before and after the PET results. With regard to the treatment strategy, four major options were recognized: (1) further diagnostic investigations; (2) medical therapy; (3) surgical treatment; (4) wait-and-see. For data analysis, intermodality changes, defined as changes between treatment strategies related to PET findings, were considered. RESULTS: Before the PET study, the planned management for the overall patient population was as follows: further diagnostic investigations in 44 cases (58%), medical therapy in 17 (23%), surgical treatment in nine (12%) and wait-and-see in five (7%). After the PET study, further diagnostic tools were indicated in 27 cases (36%), medical therapy in 17 (23%), surgical treatment in 28 (37%) and wait-and-see in three (4%). Relative to the initially planned strategy, changes in patient management after PET imaging occurred in 34 (45%) cases. Overall, the most relevant variation after PET concerned the surgical treatment strategy. The highest percentage (67%) of changes in management after PET was found in patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule; the percentages of changes of the three patient groups were significantly different (chi-squared test; P=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with known or suspected lung cancer, F-FDG PET results determined significant variations in major clinical management decisions.
