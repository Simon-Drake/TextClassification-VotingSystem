Percutaneous cryoablation as a salvage therapy for local recurrence of lung cancer.
A 66-year-old male was diagnosed with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer, and underwent chemoradiotherapy, to which he achieved a partial response. During subsequent follow-up, positron emission tomography showed a fluorodeoxyglucose uptake lesion within the primary tumor, without evidence of metastatic foci elsewhere in the body. As local disease progression was most suspected, cryoablation was performed for the lesion with high fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. After treatment, there has been no evidence of recurrence for 12 months. Herein, we present a case of percutaneous cryoablation as a salvage therapy for recurrent lung cancer after chemoradiotherapy.
