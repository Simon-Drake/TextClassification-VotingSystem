[A case of endobronchial actionomycosis evaluated by FDG-PET].
In April 2005, a 78-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because an abnormal chest shadow had been noted on a medical examination. Our investigation revealed primary squamous cell lung carcinoma in the right lower lobe (stage IIIA). Right middle and lower lobectomies including resection of the chest wall were performed. 18Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) conducted 18 months later demonstrated nodular lesions with intense FDG activity in the right upper lobe and the presence of a post-resection positive bronchial stump. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination revealed a pus-coated mass located in the endobronchial lesion, and Actinomyces was identified in a biopsy specimen of the mass. Endobronchial actinomycosis was diagnosed. An FDG-PET examination conducted after the patient was treated with amoxicillin (AMPC) for 2 months, did not indicate any FDG activity in the endobronchial lesion.
