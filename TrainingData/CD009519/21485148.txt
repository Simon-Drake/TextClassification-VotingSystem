[A case of primary pulmonary leiomyosarcoma with multiple nodular lesions in the lungs].
Multiple pulmonary nodular lesions were noted on a chest X-ray film of a 56-year-old man. Partial resection of the left lung via thoracoscopy was performed, yielding a pathological diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and other examinations revealed that the lesions originated in the lung. Chemotherapy with adriamycin and ifosfamide was performed but was ineffective. It is reported that leiomyosarcoma with multiple pulmonary nodules often derives from a uterine primary lesion. Primary pulmonary leiomyosarcoma with multiple nodular lesions is rare, but it should be considered in the differential diagnosis in cases with multiple lung nodules.
