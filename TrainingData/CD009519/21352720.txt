[Small-cell lung carcinoma: CT imaging features].
Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) typically is central in location. It is a very aggressive tumor characterized by its propensity for invasion of mediastinal structures, frequently, the ipsilateral pulmonary artery, multifocal nodal metastases and high frequency of distant metastases at initial presentation. CT is very sensitive and effective for local and regional staging. Combined with other diagnostic modalities, especially PET imaging, it allows whole body imaging for accurate staging, which is mandatory for therapeutic management. The different CT imaging features of SCLC and its more specific imaging characteristics will be reviewed in this article.
