F-18 FDG PET/CT imaging of submandibular gland oncocytoma.
F-18 FDG PET/CT is used to evaluate head and neck malignancies, including salivary gland tumors. We describe the FDG PET/CT features of a submandibular gland oncocytoma. An 85-year-old patient with small cell cancer of the lung and a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip was evaluated with FDG PET/CT. There was an intensely hypermetabolic left submandibular gland lesion that was suspected for a metastasis. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspirate of the lesion proved to be a submandibular gland oncocytoma.
