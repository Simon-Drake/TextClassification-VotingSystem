Thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomograms of double cancers: lung and breast.
Thallium-201 SPECT is reported in a rare case with simultaneously developing double cancers of the lung and the breast. The TI-201 SPECT was initiated to evaluate mediastinal involvement from the lung cancer, and an abnormal tracer accumulation was unexpectedly found in the breast in addition to the pulmonary lesion.
