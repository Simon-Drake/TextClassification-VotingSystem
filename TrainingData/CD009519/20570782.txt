[Surgical aspects of the new TNM system for lung cancer].
Recent results of basic research in lung cancer and development of new antitumoral drugs provided the bases for the revision of TNM system of lung cancer. In addition, the VI-th Edition of TNM classification was based on a relatively small database anyway. Multicentric analysis and biostatistical evaluation were carried out by the initiation of IASCL. 100869 patients were collected and 81015 cases were included in the analysis finally (NSCLC: 67725, SCLC: 13290). The aim of the study was to modify T, N as well as M factors of the classification. The recommendations were based on a large international database and survival analysis of that. It is expected that this change will influence treatment algorithms of lung cancer and it will improve survival of patients therefore.
