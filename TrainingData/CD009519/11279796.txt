Role of repeated F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose imaging in management of patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the impact of repeated F-18 FDG studies on the management of patients with bone and soft tissue (B&S) sarcomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients with B&S tissue tumors (11 M and 9 F age 17-72 years) had 52 F-18 FDG Dual Head Coincidence Imaging (DHCI) studies. 7 patients were followed for 6 months to 2 years clinically after removal of the primary tumor. Thirteen patients were evaluated for suspected recurrences. Patient's preparation, F-18 FDG injection and imaging procedure were done according to department protocol. Attenuation corrected images were interpreted visually by 3 trained physicians. Tumor to background ratios were calculated for all lesions. RESULTS: In 13 patients having both studies, baseline FDG and CT/MRI were concordant in 8 patients, FDG detected more lesions in 3 patients but it did not detect 4 metastatic pulmonary nodules in 2 patients. Follow up studies showed stable disease in 10 patients while 6 patients who showed worsening disease needed to change their chemotherapy. Surgery was avoided in 2 patients and 2 patients showed improved response. CONCLUSION: Repeated F-18 FDG DHCI examinations proved to have an impact on the clinical management of patients with malignant bone and soft tissue sarcoma. It helps to differentiate postoperative changes from local recurrence.
