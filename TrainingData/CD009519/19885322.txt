Percutaneous osteoplasty for the management of a femoral head metastasis: a case report.
Percutaneous osteoplasty (POP) as a technical extension of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has been used to treat malignant disease that affects the skeletal system. POP has demonstrated good outcome for pain relief and functional improvement. Few studies have reported on the efficiency of POP to treat malignancies located in the femoral head. We designed a pilot study with the use of POP to treat intractable pain caused by a femoral head metastatic tumor in a 43-year-old man. During the follow-up period, the patient experienced sustained pain relief and improvement of quality of life that persisted for more than three months.
