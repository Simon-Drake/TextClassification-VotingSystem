Functional imaging in lung cancer.
Accurate detection of the presence and extent of disease is vital in the management of non-small-cell lung cancer. While computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging tend to be the routine diagnostic modalities used in the management of lung cancer, there have been significant advances in the field of functional and molecular imaging. In this article, we review the performance of the functional imaging techniques that are currently available for the evaluation of non-small-cell lung cancer. The techniques range from evaluation of glucose metabolism in tumors with fluorodeoxyglucose, to evaluation of proliferation with fluorothymidine and evaluation of tumor hypoxia with agents such as fluoromisonidazole. Magnetic resonance imaging with an emphasis on dynamic contrast enhancement of tumors as well as detecting of malignant lymph nodes with targeted contrast agents is discussed. Emerging technologies such as lung imaging fluorescence endoscopy are considered. The role of functional imaging in planning, predicting response to, and evaluating effects of, various therapies is explored.
