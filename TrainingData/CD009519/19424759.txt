FDG-accumulating atherosclerotic plaques identified with 18F-FDG-PET/CT in 141 patients.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques based on [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in a large population characterized by high risk of cardiovascular disease. PROCEDURES: One hundred forty-one patients referred to our department for FDG-PET/CT for suspected lung cancer were re-evaluated for atherosclerotic lesions. Cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed based on patient records. RESULTS: Forty-two percent of the patients had three cardiovascular risk factors or more. Nine percent of all plaques were assessed as active FDG-accumulating plaques, 88% were inactive calcified plaques, and 2% were mixed. The abdominal aorta was the vessel with the highest plaque count. Patients with one risk factor had significantly less active and inactive plaques. CONCLUSIONS: The observed association between the numbers of cardiovascular risk factors and the numbers of FDG-accumulating plaques as well as calcified plaques further supports the validity and value of FDG-PET/CT in the non-invasive identification and characterization of atherosclerotic disease.
