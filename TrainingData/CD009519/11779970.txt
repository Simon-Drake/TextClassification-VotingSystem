Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges after complex partial status epilepticus associated with increased focal cerebral blood flow.
Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are typically associated with encephalitis, cerebral abscess, cerebral infarct, and status epilepticus. There is considerable debate as to whether this pattern is ictal or interictal when seen in association with status epilepticus. We present a patient with complex partial status epilepticus who developed PLEDs and remained comatose despite optimal drug therapy. Technetium 99m single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed hyperperfusion that resolved with further aggressive antiepileptic drug therapy, indicating that this pattern may indeed be ictal. Further studies are needed to define the significance of PLEDs in patients with status epilepticus. The role of SPECT in differentiating PLEDs as an interictal or ictal pattern also requires further study.
