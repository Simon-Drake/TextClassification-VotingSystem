Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma mimicking multiple lung metastases: report of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission findings.
Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma (PHG) is a rare disease characterized by multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules of uncertain etiology. We describe a 71-year-old female patient with thyroid papillary carcinoma in whom bilateral pulmonary nodules were found during a routine chest radiography examination. Subsequent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan gave the impression of multiple pulmonary metastases based on high maximum standardized uptake value. She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with wedge resection, and PHG was diagnosed on the basis of histopathologic findings. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PHG developing in a patient as a solid cancer, mimicking multiple pulmonary metastases. We also present the first description of positron emission tomography in PHG, according to a Medline search.
