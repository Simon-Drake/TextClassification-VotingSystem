[Detection of lymph node involvement and surgical treatment of pulmonary neoplastic processes. Current state of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures].
An analysis is made of different publications associated with the surgical staging and treatment of primary and metastasic pulmonary neoplastic processes. A suitable treatment program is essential to determine lymph node involvement in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. The indication and sequence of the procedure to use (CT-PET, transbronchial puncture, videomediastinoscopic ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration) is evaluated in accordance to the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value of the different methods. Another interesting challenge is to define the criteria for indicating a sublobar resection in certain tumours and patients. Different factors, age, lung function, tumour location and type of sublobar resection, are analysed. Levels of evidence and recommendations of the procedure are also considered. Surgical resection is an accepted therapeutic option in the treatment of colorectal cancer lung metastases. Its indication is based on acceptable survival rates and knowledge of the impact of various factors (interval free of disease, number of metastases, presence of liver metastasis, presence of lymph node involvement, or increased pre-operative levels of carcinoembryonic antigen), is analysed in detail.
