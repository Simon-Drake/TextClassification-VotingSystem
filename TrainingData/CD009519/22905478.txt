Pulmonary benign metastasizing leiomyoma: case report and review of the literature.
We present a case of a middle-aged woman who was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and was found to have multiple nodules on her CT scan. After CT-guided biopsy, we finally diagnosed PBML case. The patient had a very effective response to bilateral oophorectomy and hysterectomy. A brief review of the literature for PBML is also included.
