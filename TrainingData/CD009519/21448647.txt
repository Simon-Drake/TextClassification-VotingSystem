Possible anti-metastatic effect of iloprost in a patient with systemic sclerosis with lung cancer: a case study.
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic disease of unknown etiology which affects the vascular system and connective tissue. A wide series of studies showed an increased prevalence of cancer in patients with SSc than the normal population. Prostacyclin (PGI2) is an endogenously produced element that is basically synthesized by arachiodonic acid through prostacyclin synthesis in vascular system endothelial cells. Iloprost is a stable analogue of PGI2 which is used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In a limited number of animal models, the anti-metastatic activity of PGI2 is observed. Herein, we report iloprost treatment of a 60-year-old-woman with SSc, who lately developed PAH as a complication of her disease and lung adenocarcinoma as a co-incidence simultaneously. These two mortal complications were both treated successfully with inhaled iloprost until her death due to gastrointestinal complications of SSc.
