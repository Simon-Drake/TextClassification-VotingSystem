[A case of lung resection after chemotherapy due to lung metastases derived from esophageal cancer resection].
We report a rare case of esophageal cancer resection in which lung metastases was resected after chemotherapy with paclitaxel. A 59-year-old man with epigastralgia as a chief concern was referred to our hospital and was diagnosed with esophageal cancer by gastrointestinal fiber. In June 2007, the cancer was resected and followed by 3 courses of weekly chemotherapy with paclitaxel. In January 2009, chest computed tomography showed lung nodules (Rt-S1 and Rt-S5), and positron emission tomography (PET) showed uptake (Rt-S1); a final diagnosis of multiple lung metastases was made. Thereafter, the patient underwent 8 courses of weekly chemotherapy with paclitaxel. In December 2009, the growing Rt-S1 nodule was detected but no other lesion. The patient underwent a resection of lung metastases followed by 5 courses of weekly chemotherapy with paclitaxel. As of June 2011, the patient was alive and disease free. In conclusion, the resection of solitary lung metastases derived from esophageal cancer should be considered because it may improve survival.
