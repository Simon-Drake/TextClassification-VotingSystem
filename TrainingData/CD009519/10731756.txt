[Value of positron emission tomography with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in diagnosis of recurrent bronchial carcinoma].
The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography with 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in the detection of recurrent lung cancer. PET was performed using an ECAT ART scanner (Siemens CTI) after i.v. injection of 220 +/- 50 MBq 18FDG. PET data were analysed by visual interpretation of coronal, sagittal and transversal slices. PET scans were interpreted independently by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians without prior knowledge of the results of other imaging studies or clinical data. 40 patients (= 41 cases) who had undergone primarily curative tumour treatment, were evaluated. In 29 of 35 cases with recurrent tumour, diagnosis was verified by pathologic means. FDG-PET correctly identified tumour recurrence in 34/35 cases. In 5/6 cases without prevent tumour recurrence PET gave true negative results. The overall accuracy of FDG-PET was 39/41 = 95% (95%-confidence interval 83-99%). FDG-PET shows high diagnostic accuracy in detecting recurrent lung cancer in patients with prior curative tumour treatment, but cannot substitute the need for pathological diagnosis.
