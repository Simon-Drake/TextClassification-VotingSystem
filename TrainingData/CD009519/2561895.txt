SPECT images using 99mTc(V)-DMS in lung metastasis of osteosarcoma.
Color images of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc(V)-DMS) were demonstrated in a patient with lung metastases from osteosarcoma. SPECT image using 99mTc(V)-DMS could be useful for the detection of lung metastasis from osteosarcoma.
