Evaluation of radiotherapeutic response in non-small cell lung cancer patients by technetium-99m MIBT and thallium-201 chloride SPET.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between technetium-99m hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) accumulation in tumours and response to radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients in comparison with the findings obtained using thallium-201 chloride (201Tl). Simultaneous dual single-photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging with 600 MBq 99mTc-MIBI and 111 MBq 201Tl was performed in 31 patients with biopsy- or sputum cytology-proven lung cancer. SPET images were acquired 15 min (early) and 2 h (delayed) after injection, and the early ratio, delayed ratio and retention index were measured. The tumours were classified into two groups on the basis of follow-up computed tomography (CT): responders (at least 50% reduction in tumour size) and non-responders (little or no change in tumour size). The mean (+/-SD) values of early ratio, delayed ratio and retention index using 99mTc-MIBI SPET were 3.0+/-1.1, 2.7+/-1.0 and -9.5+/-12.7, respectively, in responders and 2.4+/-0.7, 2.0+/-0.5 and -18.4+/-9.0, respectively, in non-responders. The corresponding values using 201Tl chloride SPET were 3.7+/-1.0, 4.7+/-1.5 and 24.2+/-22.1 in responders and 3.3+/-1.2, 4.0+/-1.3 and 20.4+/-20.5 in nonresponders. Using 99mTc-MIBI, the delayed ratio and retention index in responders were significantly higher than those in non-responders (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). The results of this study indicate that patients with higher delayed ratio and retention index values using 99mTc-MIBI SPET are likely to respond better to radiotherapy than those with lower values. 99mTc-MIBI SPET may give an indication of the short-term response to radiotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
