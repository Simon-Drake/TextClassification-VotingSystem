[A case of radiologically negative small-cell lung carcinoma successfully detected early by whole-body FDG-PET].
A 68-year-old man was referred to our hospital after being treated for early gastric cancer to investigate the causative malignancy, as his serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was increased. Chest radiography showed no abnormal opacities. Subsequently, a whole-body FDG-PET was performed, which detected some tiny lesions in the mediastinum and the right lower lung field. A diagnosis of small-cell lung carcinoma was made after mediastinoscopic and bronchoscopic examinations. After chemoradiotherapy, the previously abnormal uptake of FDG was attenuated and the bronchoscopic appearance was improved, while the serum CEA and NSE levels returned to normal. Our findings demonstrated that whole-body scanning by FDG-PET could be useful for early detection of lung cancer, especially in cases of small-cell lung cancer.
