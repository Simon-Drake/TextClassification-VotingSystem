Diffuse vertebral body metastasis from a glioblastoma multiforme: a technetium-99m Sestamibi single-photon emission computerized tomography study.
The authors report on a case of right temporal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) that metastasized to multiple bone regions (dorsolumbar vertebrae and iliac bone) 8 months after initial diagnosis, despite combined radio- and chemotherapy. Results of a whole-bone single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) study using the imaging agent Sestamibi (MIBI) revealed extracranial metastases from the GBM. A magnetic resonance imaging study of the dorsolumbar spinal region completed the radiological investigation. Cells immunoreactive to glial fibrillary acidic protein were observed in a specimen obtained from the right iliac bone. Postmortem examination confirmed metastasis to extracranial bone and revealed two other metastatic localizations in the lung and heart. This is the first reported case of extracranial bone metastasis from a GBM demonstrated on a whole-bone MIBI SPECT scan. In patients with malignant glioma and lower-back pain (especially prolonged pain), bone metastasis, although uncommon, does occasionally occur and its possibility should be investigated; a MIBI SPECT study may prove useful in this regard.
