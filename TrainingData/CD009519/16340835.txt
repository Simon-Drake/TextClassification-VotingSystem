[PET scanning in the initial assessment of lung cancer].
18FDG-PET scanning enables the imaging of metabolic activity giving an assessment of the local extent of thoracic malignancies as well as an indication of the presence of nodal or metastatic spread. This enables more accurate staging and has revolutionised the management of lung cancer. National and international guidelines describe the role of this technique.
