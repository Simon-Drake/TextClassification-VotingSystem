Combining bronchoscopy and positron emission tomography for the diagnosis of the small pulmonary nodule < or = 3 cm.
AIM: To assess the role of bronchoscopy and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in an integrated approach for the diagnosis of noncalcified, small, chest radiologic lesions (< or = 3 cm). METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive patients (29 men; mean age, 64 years) with a pulmonary nodule < or = 3 cm undergoing both combined PET and bronchoscopy were included. When bronchoscopy and PET findings were negative, a multidisciplinary decision was taken to perform further invasive diagnostics or follow-up. RESULTS: Malignancy was diagnosed in 51 patients (69%), and a positive benign diagnosis was made in 9 patients (12%). Six patients (8%) had endobronchial lesions. Bronchoscopy was diagnostic in 53% patients (cancer, n = 35; benign, n = 4). PET findings were positive in 19 of 35 patients with a nondiagnostic bronchoscopy. In these 19 patients, malignant diagnosis was made in 14 patients (CT-fine needle aspiration [FNA], n = 3; thoracoscopic biopsy, n = 3; resection, n = 7; FNA of PET-positive supraclaviclar lymph node, n = 1), and a benign diagnosis was made in 5 patients (CT-FNA, n = 1; thoracoscopic biopsy, n = 1; resection, n = 1; follow-up, n = 2). In 16 patients with nondiagnostic bronchoscopy and negative PET findings, 5 patients had a tissue diagnosis (cancer, n = 2 [< 1 cm]; benign, n = 3) and 11 patients were followed up. Sixty-seven patients had a lesion 11 mm to 3 cm; among these, all 12 patients who were bronchoscopy negative and PET negative had benign lesions. In 24 patients without mediastinal adenopathy (solitary pulmonary nodule), bronchoscopy was diagnostic in 12 patients (cancer, n = 11; bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, n = 1). In the remaining 12 patients, PET findings were positive in 6 patients (cancer, n = 3; resection, n = 2; CT-FNA, n = 1) and negative in 6 patients (benign, n = 2, both on resection; follow-up, n = 4). CONCLUSION: Combining bronchoscopy and PET scanning has an useful role in the diagnosis of noncalcified chest radiologic lesions < or = 3 cm in size. Bronchoscopy has a diagnostic yield of > 50% and also allows the diagnosis of endobronchial lesions. If bronchoscopy is nondiagnostic, a PET scan should be performed.
