Restoration of gefitinib efficacy following chemotherapy in a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
BACKGROUND: Gefitinib has shown evidence of antitumor activity in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CASE REPORT: A female Asian nonsmoker with adenocarcinoma was given gefitinib as first-line treatment with significant efficacy. However, after approximately 1.5 years, progression occurred. She then received chemotherapy (pemetrexed/carboplatin) until progression, followed by treatment with gefitinib to which the patient responded a second time. After progression, treatment with chemotherapy (docetaxel/cisplatin) was instituted and again followed by gefitinib. A recent positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan showed complete remission under gefitinib. CONCLUSIONS: This case report indicates that resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC can be reversed after chemotherapy. Thus, re-exposure to gefitinib may be justified in selected cases.
