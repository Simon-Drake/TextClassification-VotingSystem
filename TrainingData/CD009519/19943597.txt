Primary primitive neuro-ectodermal tumour of the lung.
A case of intrapulmonary primitive neuro-ectodermal tumour (PNET) without thoracic wall involvement is presented in a 33-year-old man. PNET of the thoracopulmonary region, also called Askin tumour, is a rare undifferentiated sarcoma usually involving the thoracic wall. Primary intrapulmonary PNET without parietal pleura or thoracic wall involvement is very rare. The correlation between anatomo-pathological aspects and clinical imaging is emphasized, which is discussed in the light of the most recent literature.
