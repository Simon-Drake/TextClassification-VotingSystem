Assessment of pulmonary lesions with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron imaging using coincidence mode gamma cameras.
UNLABELLED: Accurate assessment of lung carcinoma remains a significant clinical problem, often leading to surgical procedures without curative potential. PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has shown promise in differentiating benign from malignant lesions and in staging the extent of disease, resulting in improved treatment at a significant cost savings. This multicenter prospective study used dual-detector coincidence imaging with FDG to categorize pulmonary lesions as benign or malignant. The goal of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of dual-detector coincidence imaging of FDG in patients with pulmonary lesions who were scheduled to have a diagnostic procedure for histopathologic confirmation. METHODS: A total of 96 patients with pulmonary lesions with a lesion size ranging from 1 to 7 cm with a mean of 3.44 cm based on their chest radiograph or CT scan were studied using FDG scans with a dual-detector coincidence detection system. An additional 24 patients were entered as control subjects. The studies of 120 subjects were interpreted in random order by three physicians experienced in the use of FDG in patients with lung cancer. Surgical pathology was used as the standard for identifying malignant lesions. RESULTS: There was 94% agreement between the readers in the independent interpretation of the FDG studies. In the 96 patients with pulmonary lesions, FDG studies were 97% sensitive and 80% specific in identifying proven malignant lesions. CONCLUSION: The results of this prospective study provide evidence that dual-detector coincidence imaging with FDG provides an accurate, sensitive and specific means of diagnosing malignancy in patients with pulmonary lesions.
