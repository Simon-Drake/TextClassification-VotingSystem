Sister Mary Joseph's nodule that originated from lung adenocarcinoma.
Umbilical metastasis of cancer, known as Sister Mary Joseph's nodule (SMJN), is a rare phenomenon. It is usually due to intraabdominal malignancies and is quite rare from lung cancer. Here we describe a case of SMJN that originated from advanced lung adenocarcinoma. SMJN should be noted as an important sign of some hidden malignancy including lung cancer.
