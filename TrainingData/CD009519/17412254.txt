ACR Appropriateness Criteria on solitary pulmonary nodule.
The solitary pulmonary nodule is traditionally defined as a relatively spherical opacity 3 cm or less in diameter surrounded by lung parenchyma. The choice of imaging test to evaluate solitary nodules is extensive. However, only 2 findings are considered to be sufficient to preclude further evaluation: calcification in a benign pattern and stability in size for more than 2 years.
