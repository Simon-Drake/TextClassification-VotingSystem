[Value of 16-slice spiral CT in the diagnosis of tumor-like bronchial tuberculosis].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of 16-slice multi-detector CT (MDCT) in the diagnosis of tumor-like bronchial tuberculosis. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with tumor-like bronchial tuberculosis underwent 16-slice CT scanning and the CT data were analyzed. RESULTS: Tumor-like bronchial tuberculosis were classified into 4 types according to the imaging features, namely intra-lumen nodule, intra-lumen mass, compression from outside of the bronchial lumens, and lung hilum mass. Tumor-like bronchial tuberculosis was featured by irregular bronchial wall thickening which led to decreased internal diameter of the bronchi with the external diameter remaining unchanged, ring-shaped enhancement, and absence of clear boundaries between the lesion and normal bronchi. CONCLUSION: 16-slice MDCT can be advantageous in displaying tumor-like bronchial tuberculosis, and axial scan with 16-slice spiral CT combined with image reconstruction allows detection of the lesions inside the trachea and bronchus.
