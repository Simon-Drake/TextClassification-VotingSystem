[Surgical resection of metachronous multiple lung cancer after complete response of small cell lung cancer; report of a case].
A 76-year-old man underwent combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide and 50 Gy radiotherapy for left-sided small cell lung cancer in 1999. He achieved clinical complete response and showed no sign of recurrence on follow-up study. In December 2004, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 1 cm nodule in the right lung. Although no diagnosis could be made by bronchoscope, we suspected metachronous multiple lung cancer because of high 18fluorodeoxyglucose uptake with positron emission tomography (PET). The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in May 2005; the frozen section diagnosis was adenocarcinoma.
