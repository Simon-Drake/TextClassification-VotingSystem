Incorporation of functional status into dose-volume analysis.
The dose-volume histogram (DVH) has gained wide acceptance as a mechanism for reducing the voluminous data of a three-dimensional dose distribution into a two-dimensional graph. These graphs are often converted to a single figure of merit. This data reduction technique is used both for clinical treatment plan evaluation and as part of proposed systems for estimating control and complication probabilities. It has long been recognized that a major shortcoming of the DVH as an analysis tool is that all spatial information is discarded. A subtler problem, which is addressed in this work, is that the DVH also implies homogeneity of biological consequence of irradiation in what may be a functionally heterogeneous volume of tissue. An extension to the DVH, the functional dose-volume histogram, or dose-function histogram (DFH), is proposed, that explicitly includes quantitative three-dimensional functional information. The concept is illustrated by the use of SPECT imaging to assess the functional status of irradiated lung.
