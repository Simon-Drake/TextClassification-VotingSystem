[A case of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with lung, brain and lymph node metastases recurred 8 years after hepatectomy successfully treated by operation, radiation and systemic chemotherapy using S-1/CDDP].
A 30-year-old man underwent a left lobectomy and S5/6 partial hepatectomy in August 2001 for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A lung tumor was detected by positron emission tomography (PET-CT) 8 years after the surgery. In May 2010, he received pulmonary tumor resection and the histopathological findings revealed metastasis of HCC. However a metastatic brain tumor was detected by computed tomography (CT) in September 2010, therefore surgery and radiation therapy were subsequently performed. Thereafter, metastatic hilar lymph node appeared in December 2010, therefore we performed systemic chemotherapy using S-1/cisplatin combined with radiation therapy for the metastatic tumor. The tumor was markedly decreased and no shadow was detected by PET-CT. He has been followed up in the outpatient clinic with no recurrence.
