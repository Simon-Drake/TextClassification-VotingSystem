[Significance and mechanism of MSCT perfusion scan on differentiation of NSCLC].
OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of MSCT perfusion scan on differentiation of NSCLC and to investigate its possible mechanisms. METHODS: Forty four NSCLC patients underwent CT perfusion scan by MSCT. Among them, 22 cases were selected to detected the two-dimensional tumor microvascular architecture phenotype (2D-TMAP), the relationships between CT perfusion parameters (BF, BV, PEI, TIP), and the differentiation of NSCLC were analysed by using the correlation analysis and trend test. Spearman correlation analysis was used to study the relationships between CT perfusion parameters, differentiation, and 2D-TMAP. RESULTS: The total BF, BV and PEI decreased with decreasing differentiation of NSCLC (P<0.05). The total PEI showed a positive correlation with the total MVD (P<0.05). There were negative correlations between the surrounding area BF, the total BF, BV, and PEI, the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area MVD, and expression of PCNA, respectively (P<0.05). There were positive correlations between degree of differentiation and the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area MVD (P<0.05). It was the same as degree of differentiation and expression of PCNA, VEGF, respectively. There were positive correlations between the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area MVD and expression of VEGF, ephrinB2, EphB4, and PCNA, respectively (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Perfusion parameters reflect the difference of density of vassels with mature functional lumen. Careful evaluation of the differences of blood flow pattern in pulmonary space-occupying lesions by MSCT perfusion scan can be used to identify the degree of NSCLC differentiation.
