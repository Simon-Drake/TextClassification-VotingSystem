Preliminary retrospective investigation of FDG-PET/CT timing in follow-up of ablated lung tumor.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify the most appropriate follow-up initiation time point for positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) following radio frequency ablation (RFA) of lung tumors, and the cutoff values of maximum standard uptake value (SUV(max)) to evaluate local tumor progression. METHODS: We enrolled 15 patients (8 men, median age 62 years) with 60 tumors, who were treated with RFA of lung tumors and underwent fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT following RFA. Local tumor progression was assessed by periodic chest CT images prior to and following intravenous administration of a contrast medium. The SUV(max) of three periods, namely, 0-3 months, 3-6 months, and 6-9 months after RFA, was evaluated. The appropriate time point for follow-up initiation and the cutoff value of SUV(max) were determined using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 357 days. Of 60 tumors, 10 showed local progression. The area under the ROC curve (Az) for the 6-9 months (P = 0.044) was the largest and almost equal to that of the 3-6 months (P = 0.024). Az for the 0-3 months was the smallest and statistically insignificant (P = 0.705). The cutoff value of 1.5 of SUV(max) at 3-9 months after RFA showed 77.8% sensitivity and 85.7-90.5% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The appropriate follow-up initiation time point is at least 3 months following RFA. Thus, SUV(max) is a useful and reliable predictive indicator.
