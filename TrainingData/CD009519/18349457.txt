Imaging of non-small cell lung cancer of the superior sulcus: part 1: anatomy, clinical manifestations, and management.
Non-small cell carcinomas of the superior pulmonary sulcus represent 3% of all lung cancers and are associated in most cases with a poor clinical outcome. Multimodality therapy with irradiation, chemotherapy, and surgery offers the best possibility for long-term survival and cure in most cases. For patients with pulmonary sulcus tumors that are not surgically resectable, chemoradiotherapy may help prolong survival and provide long-term pain relief. To accurately determine tumor resectability and to help optimize the planning and delivery of therapy, radiologists need a detailed knowledge of the clinical and imaging manifestations of disease in the individual patient and an awareness of the therapeutic options available. Accurate three-dimensional imaging and image interpretation are essential for mapping of the primary tumor before irradiation or surgical resection. Familiarity with the complex anatomy of the superior pulmonary sulcus is particularly crucial for determining the local-regional extension of a tumor and the most appropriate surgical approach.
