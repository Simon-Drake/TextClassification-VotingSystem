Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with 99mTc-Depreotide (NeoSpect) in discriminating between malignant and benign lesions in the diagnosis of lung cancer: a pilot study.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of a new somatostatin analog, 99mTc-Depreotide, in differentiating benign from malignant lesions in patients with pulmonary nodules or masses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A pilot study was performed on 28 patients referred to our Lung Department on suspicion of lung cancer. A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) of the thorax and upper abdomen, and scintigraphy were done--scintigraphy following the administration of 740 MBq 99mTc-Depreotide. Planar and tomographical imaging of the thorax and whole-body scanning with a gamma camera were done, and diagnostic outcome of the scintigrams was compared to CT, pathology, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Of 21 patients who had a focal high uptake of Depreotide, 17 were malignancies. One patient had two lesions with high Depreotide uptake, lung cancer, and pneumonia in the contralateral lung. Two patients with sarcoidosis and one with bilateral round atelectasis also had high Depreotide uptake bilaterally. Seven of the 8 patients with no uptake were true negative: 5 hamartomas and 2 round atelectases. One small lung cancer in the pleura sinus did not have Depreotide uptake. CONCLUSION: The somatostatin analog Depreotide is promising for discriminating between malignant and benign lung lesions.
