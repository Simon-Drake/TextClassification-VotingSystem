Lung nodule detection and characterization with multi-slice CT.
The influence of MSCT on nodule detection and characterization will be discussed. The objective is to improve understanding of the clinical issues involved in nodule detection, characterization, and management in light of technological advances. Topics to be covered are noninvasive characterization techniques, such as morphologic and density inspection on CT, nodule enhancement techniques, CT-PET, temporal nodule size assessment, and computer aided diagnosis for both detection and characterization.
