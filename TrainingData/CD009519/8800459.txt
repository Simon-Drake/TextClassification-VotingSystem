Intense and prolonged Tl-201 accumulation in a slow growing bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.
Thallium-201 SPECT was performed to evaluate a pulmonary lesion in a 73-year-old male which had been considered to be an inflammatory lesion for two years. The lesion has slowly increased in size on x-CT. Tl-201 was intensely taken up and retained in the lesion, suggesting a malignant lesion. Histological examination revealed that the lesion was bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. This case suggested that Tl-201 uptake of pulmonary carcinoma would not be necessarily related to cell growth rate.
