Molecular profiling of computed tomography screen-detected lung nodules shows multiple malignant features.
RATIONALE AND PURPOSE: Low-dose spiral computerized axial tomography (spiral CT) is effective for the detection of small early lung cancers. Although published data seem promising, there has been a significant degree of discussion concerning the potential of overdiagnosis in the context of spiral CT-based screening. The objective of the current study was to analyze the phenotypic and genetic alterations in the small pulmonary malignancies resected after detection in the University of Navarra/International Early Lung Cancer Action Project spiral CT screening trial and to determine whether their malignant molecular features are similar to those of resected lung tumors diagnosed conventionally. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed 17 biomarkers of lung epithelial malignancy in a series of 11 tumors resected at our institution during the last 4 years (1,004 high-risk individuals screened), using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A parallel series of 11 gender-, stage-, and histology-matched lung cancers diagnosed by other means except screening was used as control. RESULTS: The molecular alterations and the frequency of phenotypic or genetic aberrations were very similar when screen-detected and nonscreen-detected lung cancers were compared. Furthermore, most of the alterations found in the screen-detected cancers from this study were concordant with what has been described previously for stage I-II lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Small early-stage lung cancers resected after detection in a spiral CT-based screening trial reveal malignant molecular features similar to those found in conventionally diagnosed lung cancers, suggesting that the screen-detected cancers are not overdiagnosed.
