Herniation pit mimicking osseous metastasis on 18F-FDG PET/CT in patient with lung cancer.
Herniation pits are small subcortical osseous defects located typically at the proximal anterosuperior quadrant of the femoral neck that are most frequently seen in the young, athletic adult population. We report a case with herniation pit showing focal 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT images mimicking osseous metastasis in a 69-year-old patient with lung cancer.
