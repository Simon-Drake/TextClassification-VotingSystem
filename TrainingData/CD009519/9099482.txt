Tc-99m MIBI scintigraphy in patients with lung cancer. Comparison with CT and fluorine-18 FDG PET imaging.
Tc-99m MIBI imaging has been used to evaluate patients with different neoplastic disorders, but its role in nuclear oncology has not been definitely established. In this study, we compared the results of Tc-99m MIBI (planar and SPECT imaging) with those of F-18 FDG PET radionuclide studies in 19 patients who had proven lung cancer. One patient was studied in follow-up. All patients underwent chest CT scans. MIBI and FDG images were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using region of interest analysis. Quantitative evaluation of MIBI and FDG activities in lung-tumor lesions was performed calculating tumor/nontumor ratios. On CT, 18 lung tumors were detected, while one patient was disease free. For lung lesions, the diagnostic sensitivity of planar MIBI imaging was 83%, while those of MIBI SPECT and FDG PET were both 100%. The quantitative analysis of lung-tumor MIBI and FDG activities showed that FDG uptake was significantly (P < 0.001) higher compared with MIBI uptake (5.5 +/- 3.1 vs 2.1 +/- 0.6); concordant MIBI and FDG images were found in 4 lesions in terms of central activity defect showing central necrotic tumor tissue. For lymph node abnormalities, planar MIBI scan only detected 3 lesions in 3 patients, whereas MIBI SPECT identified 9 lesions in 5 patients. FDG PET showed 13 lymph node abnormalities in 5 patients. This study shows similar results of Tc-99m MIBI SPECT and F-18 FDG PET in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with lung tumors. However, FDG lung tumor uptake was significantly higher compared with MIBI accumulation, suggesting a high glucose tumor metabolism. Thus, MIBI SPECT imaging may be useful to evaluate such patients and may be considered an alternative when PET is not available.
