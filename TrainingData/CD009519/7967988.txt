Whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in preoperative evaluation of lung cancer.
Despite use of computed tomography, some lung cancer patients are found to have unresectable disease at surgery, or they present early with metastases. We studied whether whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) would improve the preoperative detection of metastases. We retrospectively analysed 34 patients with "operable" non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent 18FDG PET after routine assessment. Management changes produced by the PET scan and confirmatory tests were reviewed. PET identified unsuspected malignant lesions in 10 (29%) patients. Management changes occurred in 14 (41%), including 6 (18%) patients who were changed to non-surgical therapy. These data suggest that whole-body 18FDG PET improves preoperative assessment of lung cancer patients.
