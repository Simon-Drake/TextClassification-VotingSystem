A lung segmentectomy performed with 3D reconstruction images available on the operating table with an iPad.
Anatomic lung segmentectomy is the procedure of choice in a growing number of patients, either because the lesion is small and/or because of poor lung function. The procedure requires a good knowledge of intrapulmonary anatomy. However, the experience for the different types of segmentectomy is not easy to obtain during thoracic surgical training due to the relatively small number of patients. Any help to better visualize and apprehend the anatomy pre- and intraoperatively is useful for training, teaching and for performing safer surgical procedures. This paper describes an anatomic segmentectomy procedure (upper segment of the left lower lobe) performed with the assistance of an iPad tablet used during the intervention to display and manipulate 3D images reconstructed prior to the surgery with the Open Source OsiriX software.
