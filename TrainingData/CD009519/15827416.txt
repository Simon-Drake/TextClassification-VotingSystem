PET/CT imaging of metastatic deposit in vertebral Paget's disease.
Metastatic involvement in monostotic Paget's disease is an event of uncommon occurrence. An osseous metastasis, clinically and radiologically difficult to differentiate from sarcomatous degeneration, is often unexpectedly discovered during evaluation for malignant transformation of Paget's disease. The authors present a case of recurrent nonsmall cell lung carcinoma with PET/CT imaging instrumental in the diagnostic biopsy of a metastatic deposit in a pagetoid lumbar vertebra.
