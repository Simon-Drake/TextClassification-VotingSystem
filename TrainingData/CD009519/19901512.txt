[Intense 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake due to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis].
A 61-year-old woman was admitted with a tumor-like lesion in the middle lobe of the right lung which showed substantial uptake on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET). The chief complaint was dry cough. On the basis of these findings, lung cancer was first to be ruled out. However, subsequent examinations showed Aspergillus fumigatus in sputum and aspergillus-specific IgE and IgG antibodies in the serum. The tumor-like lesion gradually disappeared. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis without clinical symptom of bronchial asthma was diagnosed with Rosenberg's clinical criteria. The patient's condition stabilized after treatment with inhaled corticosteroid and oral itraconazole. To our knowledge, this is the second report of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with tumor-like lesions in the lung showing intense 18FDG-PET uptake.
