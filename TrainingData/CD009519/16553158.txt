PET/CT following intensity-modulated radiation therapy for primary lung tumor in a dog.
A primary lung tumor in a dog treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy was imaged approximately 6 weeks and 1-year posttreatment with combined positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography, utilizing the radiotracers 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-fluorothymidine. These two tracers allowed discrimination of tumor from inflammation, and demonstrated spread of tumor along airways over time after treatment. Fusion of functional imaging with anatomic imaging is a useful tool, particularly in the field of oncology, with the potential for PET markers that delineate tumor from normal or reactive tissue, and potential or actual response to therapy.
