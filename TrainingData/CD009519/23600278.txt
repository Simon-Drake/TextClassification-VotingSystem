[Effect of combined modality treatment with intraoperative radiotherapy on the morphofunctional state of the myocardium in patients with stage-III lung cancer].
Epy influence of combined treatment including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radical surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy with a single dose of 15 Gr or 10 Gr has been studied in conditions of radiosensibilization on morphological and functional status of myocardium in non-small lung cancer patients at stage III with by means of ECG-synchronized single-photon emission computed tomography of myocardium with 99mTc MIBI. It was shown that this kind of treatment does not worsen functional status of myocardium, besides the perfusion level of myocardium correlated with initial concomitant cardiovascular pathology and extent of surgical treatment.
