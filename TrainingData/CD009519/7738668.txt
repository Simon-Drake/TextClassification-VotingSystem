Optimum scanning protocol for FDG-PET evaluation of pulmonary malignancy.
UNLABELLED: FDG-PET can differentiate benign from malignant focal pulmonary opacities. We performed dynamic FDG-PET studies to determine the optimum time for emission data acquisition. METHODS: Patients with focal pulmonary abnormalities demonstrated by biopsy to be malignant (n = 10) or benign (n = 4) were evaluated with dynamic FDG-PET. Dynamic PET data were acquired as sequential 5-min images for 2.5 hr. Radioactivity concentration measurements of the focal abnormality, a similar area in the opposite lung, and both lungs in the field of view were made throughout the period of acquisition. Standardized uptake ratios (SUR) of the lesions were calculated. SUR data and lesion-to-background ratios were plotted. The time that the SUR provided the maximum separation between benign and malignant masses after FDG administration was determined. RESULTS: The SUR values provided the greatest separation between benign and malignant abnormalities beginning at 50 min and no advantage was identified in imaging later. Achievement of a 4:1 lesion-to-background ratio occurred by 50 min in malignant lesions. CONCLUSION: The acquisition of the emission data used in the evaluation of pulmonary malignancy should begin approximately 50 min after FDG administration.
