Pulmonary Paragonimus westermani with false-positive fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography mimicking primary lung cancer.
We report the case of a 66-year-old woman with pulmonary Paragoniumus westermani showing false-positive fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomograpy (FDG-PET). Based on chest computed tomography and FDG-PET findings, we could not rule out the possibility of primary lung cancer. She underwent right middle and lower lobectomies as a primary lung cancer. As a possibility in the differential diagnosis of a pulmonary nodule with FDG-PET positive findings, paragonimiasis should be considered, although it is rarely seen.
