[Differential diagnosis of benign and malignant solitary pulmonary nodule with computer-aided detection].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the morphological features of benign and malignant solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) and explore the radiological evidences for the differentiation of SPNs. METHODS: With SPN Dicom View software, we analyzed and compared images obtained from 23 patients with malignant SPNs and 22 patients with benign SPNs who received CT scanning with or without contrast medium injection. RESULTS: The enhancement in malignant SPNs group was significantly higher than in the benign SPNs group (P < 0.0001). The irregular enhancement in malignant SPNs group was significantly higher than in the benign SPNs group (P = 0. 0084). The mean range of enhancement was (45.04 +/- 26.76) HU in malignant SPNs group, which was significantly higher than that in the benign SPNs group [(15.70 +/- 17.84) HU, P = 0.033]. The mean peak enhancement value was (136.09 +/- 41.72) HU in malignant SPNs group, which was significantly higher than in benign SPNs group [ (60.60 +/- 60.27) HU, P = 0.007]. The mean enhancement area was (21.69 +/- 21.01)% in malignant SPNs group and (8.61 +/- 10.83)% in benign SPNs group (P = 0.203). CONCLUSION: The enhancement range and peak enhancement value as well as the morphologically irregular enhancement of SPNs may provide useful information in the clinical radiological diagnosis of SPNs.
