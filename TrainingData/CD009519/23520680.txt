Merkel cell carcinoma--a rare cause of non-healing skin ulcer: a case report.
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare tumour of skin which needs to be differentiated from other small cell tumours like small-cell carcinoma of lung, melanoma, and lymphoma. Definitive diagnosis is made by immunohistochemistry and staining positively with cytokeratin. There is very little data regarding treatment of metastatic MCC and many questions remain unanswered. MCC is a chemosensitive tumour and many different chemotherapeutic regimens have been used alone or in combination with radiotherapy to treat metastatic MCC. Although complete and partial responses are achieved, they are mostly short lived and tumour usually recurs. Here a case is reported who had partial remission with chemotherapy (etoposide and cisplatin) and radiation therapy in a patient with metastatic MCC.
