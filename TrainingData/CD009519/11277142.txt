Surgical resection for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer.
BACKGROUND: Isolated pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer are rare. The present study reports on the 15-year experience of the Royal Prince Alfred Unit and discusses means of improving survival outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective review, over a 15-year period, of 41 patients who had resectable pulmonary metastases of colorectal origin. RESULTS: Most were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Seventy-two per cent had solitary metastases. The most common procedure performed was a lobectomy. Median follow up was 21 months. Five-year survival was 24%. There were no significant prognostic indicators except for the ability to achieve clear surgical margins. CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality have not altered significantly over time. But an improved selection process such as the use of preoperative positron emission tomography will potentially improve survival outcomes.
