Functional retention of Tc-99m MIBI in mediastinal lymphomas as a predictor of chemotherapeutic response demonstrated by consecutive thoracic SPECT imaging.
Tc-99m MIBI is used as a tumor imaging agent and has been proposed to measure p-glycoprotein function, which plays an important role in tumor multidrug resistance to chemotherapy. It has been reported that lung cancer and breast cancer with a high retention of Tc-99m MIBI have been more responsive to chemotherapy than tumors with low retention. Thus Tc-99m MIBI SPECT could be used as a measure of p glycoprotein function and consequently may serve as a predictor of the tumor's responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents. Described here are two patients with lymphomas, one with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the other with Hodgkin's disease, who underwent Tc-99m MIBI thoracic SPECT before and after chemotherapy. The sequential studies demonstrated a reduction in tumor size and diminished tumor uptake in one patient and disappearance of tumor uptake after a course of chemotherapy in the other patient. The data suggest that elevated Tc-99m MIBI uptake in a tumor as a result of retention by p glycoprotein not only demonstrates mediastinal involvement of lymphomas but also may be used to forecast responsiveness to chemotherapy.
