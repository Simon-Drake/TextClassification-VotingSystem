Metastatic common bile duct cancer from pulmonary adenocarcinoma presenting as obstructive jaundice.
We report an extremely rare case of metastatic common bile duct cancer from pulmonary adenocarcinoma presenting as obstructive jaundice. The patient was a 76-year-old male, who presented with generalized weakness and right upper quadrant pain. Plain chest X-ray noted multiple small nodules in both lung fields. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed a stricture of the mid common bile duct along with ductal wall enhancement. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a concentric, abrupt narrowing of the mid-common bile duct suggestive of primary bile duct cancer. However, pathology comfirmed metastatic common bile duct cancer arising from pulmonary adenocarcinoma with immunohistochemical study with thyroid transcriptional factor-1 (TTF-1).
