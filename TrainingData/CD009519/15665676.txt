Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of solitary pulmonary nodules: utility of kinetic patterns in differential diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility of dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a 3-dimensional (3D) gradient recalled echo (GRE) volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) sequence to differentiate between benign and malignant solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs). METHODS: Dynamic 3D GRE VIBE was performed in 45 patients with SPNs. For each lesion, the morphologic parameters, including the edge configuration, presence of peripheral enhancement (PE), and an internal signal on T2-weighted images, and the kinetic enhancement parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: All 29 of the malignant SPNs had internal enhancement, whereas 13 (81%) of the benign SPNs did not exhibit internal enhancement. A washout pattern was only observed in the malignant SPNs. The presence of PE was found in 56% of the benign SPNs and in 50% of the malignant SPNs. The lesion size was significantly different between malignant SPNs with PE and those without PE (P <0.01). The positive predictive value for malignancy was 91% (29 of 32 malignant SPNs). The negative predictive value was 100% (13 of 13 benign SPNs). CONCLUSIONS: A combination of morphologic criteria and kinetic information is useful for differentiating between benign and malignant SPNs. In particular, internal enhancement with PE and positive visual washout is thought be a useful tool.
