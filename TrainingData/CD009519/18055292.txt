Spectrum of findings and usefulness of integrated PET/CT in patients with known or suspected neuroendocrine tumors of the lung.
Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been known to increase diagnostic accuracy in differentiating benign and malignant lung lesions and to improve identification of lymph node and extrathoracic metastasis in pulmonary neoplasms. In this review, the authors describe the spectrum of integrated PET/CT findings on neuroendocrine (NE) tumors of the lung. We also demonstrate the usefulness of this imaging modality in patients with known or suspected NE tumors of the lung.
