18F-FDG-PET/CT as an indicator for resection of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.
A 60-year-old man with a 7-year history of multiple pulmonary nodules presented to our hospital because the nodules were seen to have increased in size on review of films on a regular medical checkup 1 week earlier. Computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple pulmonary nodules with calcification in the lungs. The largest nodule measuring 2.5 cm in the maximum dimension was lobulated and ill-defined. The patient underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (18F-FDG-PET/CT) to evaluate the multiple nodules and to search for a primary lesion. 18F-FDG-PET/CT revealed increased uptake in only two nodules with a standardized uptake value of 4.61 and 2.10, respectively. The two foci with increased 18F-FDG uptake were resected and pathologically proven to be pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH). PEH can transform into malignancy with metastasis. An 18F-FDG-PET/CT finding may be an indicator to decide on PEH resection.
