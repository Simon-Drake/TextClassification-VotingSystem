[A case of lung tuberculosis which also incidentally found intestinal tuberculosis by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography].
A 60-year-old women presenting with an abnormal shadow on a chest X-ray film was admitted to our hospital in June 2004. Her CT scan of the chest showed a cavitary mass shadow in the left upper lobe. FDG-PET was performed to examine whether this shadow was the lung cancer or not, and incidentally it showed an additional accumulation of FDG in the ileocecal resion. The colonoscopy was then carried out. Luminal narrowing with circumferential ulcer in the ileocecal resion could be observed, and pathological findings of the biopsy specimen revealed epithelioid cell granulomas. Partial lobectomy of the left upper lung was also performed, and the histological examination revealed typical pulmonary tuberculosis. Since the antituberculosis therapy was effective to the ileocecal lesion, we assert that the ileocecal lesion was intestinal tuberculosis.
