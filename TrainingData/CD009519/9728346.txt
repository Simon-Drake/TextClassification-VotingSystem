[Positron emission tomography and bone scintigraphy of an osteoclast metastasis].
We present the case of a 66-year-old-male patient who suffered from a bronchial carcinoma with a rib metastasis which was detected by PET staging with a relevant 18F-FDG-Uptake. The bone scintigram with 99mTc-DPD showed a defect in this area. The aggressive disease induced no osteoblastic response.
