Metabolic super scan in F-FDG PET/CT imaging.
A 50-yr-old man presented with intermittent hemoptysis and was diagnosed small cell lung cancer. (18)F-FDG PET/CT for staging demonstrated extensive hypermetabolic lesions throughout the skeleton and liver. Interestingly, skeletal muscles of limbs, mediastinum, bowel, and especially brain showed very low FDG uptake. Because of some characteristics in common with super scan on skeletal scintigraphy, this case could be considered as 'metabolic super scan'.
