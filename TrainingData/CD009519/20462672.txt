[Perivascular epithelioid tumors: Utility of the positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose (PET-TAC FDG) in their staging and follow-up].
Perivascular epithelioid tumors (PEComas) are a rare group of mesenchymal neoplasms with an unpredictable natural history and uncertain malignant potential. Uterine involvement and their association with tuberous sclerosis are typical for these tumors. We present a case of a 40-year old patient who was incidentally diagnosed of a uterine PEComa and serial studies of PET-CT with FDG were performed for staging and therapeutic response assessment. FDG PET-CT proved to be a valuable tool for detecting unsuspected pulmonary metastases and defining the reassessment of the patient after chemotherapy. The findings suggest that since this is a rare tumor, which does not always have benign behaviour, PET-CT may be a useful diagnostic imaging procedure for staging and clinical monitoring of patients who suffer this type of tumors.
