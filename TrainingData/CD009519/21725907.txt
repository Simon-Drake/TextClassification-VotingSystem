[Interventional radiological therapies in lung oncology].
Interventional radiological procedures for the treatment of primary and secondary pulmonary malignancies have become increasingly important. In addition to thermally ablative treatment, selective chemoembolisation by a vascular access allows localised therapy. These treatments are considered to be palliative for patients in a reduced general condition which does not allow systemic chemotherapy. In functionally inoperable patients especially the ablative procedures are potentially curative alternatives to surgery. This article provides an overview of the currently used interventional radiological procedures in lung oncology and assesses their importance. Further studies are needed to show whether interventional radiological procedures, which are promising due to their favourable risk-benefit ratio, may represent an alternative to radiotherapy or be effective in multimodal approaches.
