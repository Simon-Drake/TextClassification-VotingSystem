[Correlation between multi-slice spiral CT pulmonary perfusion imaging and cavity of microvessel in lung cancer].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between multi-slice spiral CT pulmonary perfusion imaging and the cavity of microvessel in lung cancer. METHODS: Altogether 36 patients with malignant nodules who underwent multi-slice spiral CT perfusion scan were examined.The perfusion parameters were collected and compared with the microvessel density (MVD), the incomplete lumen MVD, and the differentiation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patients were divided into a hyper-perfusion group and a hypo-perfusion group by the value of perfusion parameters. The maturity of microvessel and the degree of differentiation in NSCLC between the 2 groups was analyzed. RESULTS: Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and peak enhancement image(PEI) of the malignant nodules were (39.7+/-11.5) mL/(100 mg.min), (8.6+/-3.8)mL/100 g, and (20.1+/-8.6)HU, respectively. There was a positive correlation between PEI and MVD(r=0.645,P<0.01), and a negative correlation between BF and MVD(r=-0.280,P=0.048). There were negative correlations of BF, BV, PEI with the incomplete lumen MVD (P<0.05). BF had the highest correlation coefficient(r=-0.882,P<0.01).The incomplete lumen MVD of the hyper-perfusion group was significantly lower than that of hypo-perfusion group (P<0.05),but there was no significant difference in MVD between the 2 groups. There were negative correlations of BF, BV,PEI with the degree of differentiation (P<0.05). BF had the highest correlation coefficient(r=-0.751,P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Multi-slice spiral CT pulmonary perfusion imaging is helpful to evaluate the degree of differentiation and status of angiogenesis in lung cancer, and its basis is the cavity of microvessel.
