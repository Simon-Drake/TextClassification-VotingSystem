Positron emission tomography of lung tumors and mediastinal lymph nodes using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose. The Members of the PET-Lung Tumor Study Group.
Positron emission tomography detects increased glucose uptake in malignant tissue using the glucose analogue [2-18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. We reviewed the scans obtained in 62 patients with lung tumors. All had undergone computed tomography and had tissue-based diagnoses: 22 had adenocarcinomas, 12 had squamous cell carcinomas, 13 had other malignancies, 1 had organizing pneumonia, 1 had a hamartoma, and 13 had granulomas. Positron emission tomography with [2-18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose identified 44 of 47 malignancies. Two of three false-negative findings were tumors that were 1 cm2 or less and the other was a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. All three false-positive findings were granulomas. The sensitivity and specificity of the technique were 93.6% and 80%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 93.6% and 80%, respectively. The differential uptake ratio was determined in all 62 patients. The mean differential uptake ratio (+/- the standard error of the mean) for malignant tumors was 6.4 +/- 0.56 and that for benign tumors was 1.14 +/- 0.26 (p < 0.0001, t test). Twenty-five of the patients had N2 lymph nodes evaluated pathologically. Positron emission tomography with [2-18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose identified negative N2 nodes in 19 of 22 patients (86%) with negative nodes and positive N2 nodes in 2 of 3 patients (66%) with positive nodes, including one instance missed by computed tomography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
