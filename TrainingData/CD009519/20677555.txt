[99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2 uptake kinetics difference among KMB17 human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast and different human lung cancer cells].
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: PET/CT imaging is expensive, so searching the tumor imaging agent for SPECT/CT is necessary. 99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2 [bis (N-ethoxy-N-ethyl dithiocarbamato) nitrido 99Tc(m) (V)] can be uptaken by lung cancer cells and other cells alike. The aim of this study is to evaluate the distinctive value in lung tumor with 99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2, the difference in its uptake kinetics in human embryonic lung diploid fibroblasts KMB17 and several kinds of lung cancer cells lines. METHODS: Firstly, six different cell culture medium which contained YTMLC Gejiu human lung squamous carcinoma cell, SPC-A1 human lung adenocarcinoma cell, AGZY low metastatic human lung adenocarcinoma, 973 high metastatic human lung adenocarcinoma cell, GLC-82 Gejiu human lung adenocarcinoma cell, and KMB17 human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast, respectively with equal cell density of 1 x 10(6)/mL and the same volume were prepared; secondly, the same radioactive dose of 99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2 was added into each sample and then 300 microL mixed sample was taken out respectively and cultured in 37 degrees C culture box; Finally, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 75 min, 90 min after cultivation, centrifuged each cultured sample and determined the intracellular radiocounts of each sample, calculated each cell sample's uptake rate of 99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2 at different time. RESULTS: Statistical difference was found among six cell samples, and the uptake rate sequence from high to low is 973 and SPC-A1 > YTMLC > GLC-82 > AGZY > KMB17 respectively; furthermore, 30 min-45 min after culture, the uptake rate reached stability, and the 45 min uptake rate of each sample was higher than its 96.7% uptake peak. CONCLUSION: Based on the results above mentioned, it is supposed that there are discriminative clinical value when using 99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2 as a tumor targeting imaging agent, and 30 min or so after injection may be the best imaging time in the early imaging stage.
