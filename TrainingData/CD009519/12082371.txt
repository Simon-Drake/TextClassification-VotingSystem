Imaging of thoracic occupational and environmental malignancies.
The imaging features of occupational lung cancer are similar to those of nonoccupational cancer. Occupational lung cancer in patients with asbestos exposure must be differentiated from mimics such as round atelectasis and fissural pleural plaques. Mesothelioma remains a largely incurable tumor, though treatment options are expanding. CT, MRI, and PET scanning may all have complementary roles in staging mesothelioma.
