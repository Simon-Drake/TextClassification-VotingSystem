Surgically resected isolated hepatic metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer: a case report.
We treated a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an isolated hepatic metastasis. He was a 56-year-old male who underwent right pneumonectomy after concurrent chemoradiation therapy (etoposide+cisplatin) with the diagnosis of stage IIIA squamous cell lung carcinoma. Seven months later, an isolated hepatic metastasis was found on a PET-CT scan. Hepatic segmentectomy was performed, and the pathology showed squamous cell carcinoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy with five cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin was also given. The patient has been followed with PET-CT and CT scanning every 6 months, and there is no evidence of relapse at more than 5 years after the diagnosis of NSCLC. This shows that the surgical resection of an isolated hepatic metastasis may be an option in carefully selected patients with NSCLC without evidence of disease outside the liver.
