[The usefulness of PET/CT in lung cancer].
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Accurate staging is essential for the optimal management and treatment of these patients. Positron emission tomography (PET) and, more recently, PET/CT have been introduced into the diagnostic algorithms for oncologic patients because they provide valuable functional information. The hybrid PET/CT technique acquires both anatomic (CT) and metabolic (PET) images in a single session, combining the benefits of each modality and minimizing their limitations. This article reviews the role of PET/CT in lung cancer staging, with emphasis on non-small cell carcinoma, evaluating the advantages and limitations of the technique. Other applications of the technique, such as planning radiotherapy, are also discussed.
