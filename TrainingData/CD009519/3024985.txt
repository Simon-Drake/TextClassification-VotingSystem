Assessment of SPECT ventilation-perfusion imaging in patients with lung cancer.
Ventilation and perfusion SPECT images during tidal breathing were studied in 15 cases of lung cancer using 81mKr gas and 99mTc-microspheres. Furthermore, functional images of V/Q ratio and Q/V ratio were prepared, and their clinical significance is discussed with reference to general lung function. There was a decrease in %VC and %FEV 1.0 in 7 of 15 cases, and an increase of AaDo2 in the blood gas analysis in 12 of 15 cases. Both planar and SPECT images showed ventilation and perfusion abnormalities in all 15 cases. Of these, 12 patients showed matched ventilation and perfusion defects, 2 patients a dead-space effect and 1 patient a shunt effect. In comparing planar and SPECT images, depiction of ventilation and perfusion impairments were equally clear in 11 cases, but in 3, showing a lobar or segmental defect with a shunt effect, the SPECT images were superior. In a patient with markedly impaired function of the affected lung, the remaining function could not be depicted by SPECT. From the above, it seems that better information can be obtained for understanding the ventilation and perfusion states of lung cancer by adding the SPECT images to the planar image.
