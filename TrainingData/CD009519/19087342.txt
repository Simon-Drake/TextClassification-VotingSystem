Primary lung tumour visualised by transthoracic echocardiography.
We present images of a rare case where a primary lung tumour was visualised by transthoracic echocardiography. The patient was a 78-year-old male where Chest X-ray had revealed a tumour-suspected structure in the left lung. Both transthoracic echocardiography and combined PET/CT images showed a large tumour located close to the heart. Fine-needle biopsy showed non-small cell lung cancer.
