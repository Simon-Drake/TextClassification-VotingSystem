Lung cancer. Diagnostic tools.
Early diagnosis of lung cancer represents the best method for improving survival rates. The diagnostic aids available have improved exponentially on old and new techniques over the past 20 years. The greatest impact has been in computed tomography and positron emission tomography scanning imaging techniques. In the future, these techniques will improve, and others such as monoclonal antibody scans and antisense imaging techniques will certainly further enhance the physician's ability to diagnose earlier, and thereby, treat earlier.
