Intraoperative microwave ablation of pulmonary malignancies with tumor permittivity feedback control: ablation and resection study in 10 consecutive patients.
PURPOSE: To determine histologic changes induced by microwave ablation (MWA) in patients with pulmonary malignancy by using an ablation system with tumor permittivity feedback control, enabling real-time modulation of energy power and frequency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and patient informed consent were obtained for this prospective HIPAA-complaint ablation and resection study. Between March 2009 and January 2010, 10 patients (four women, six men; mean age, 71 years; age range, 52-82 years) underwent intraoperative MWA of pulmonary malignancies. Power (10-32 W) and frequency (908-928 MHz) were continuously adjusted by the generator to maintain a temperature of 110 degrees -120 degrees C at the 14-gauge antenna tip for one 10-minute application. After testing for an air leak, tumors were resected surgically. Gross inspection, slicing, and hematoxylin-eosin (10 specimens) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (six specimens) staining were performed. RESULTS: Tumors included adenocarcinomas (n = 5), squamous cell carcinomas (n = 3), and metastases from endometrial (n = 1) and colorectal (n = 1) primary carcinomas. Mean maximum tumor diameter was 2.4 cm (range, 0.9-5.0 cm), and mean maximum volume was 8.6 cm(3) (range, 0.5-52.7 cm(3)). One air leak was detected. Five of 10 specimens were grossly measurable, revealing a mean maximum ablation zone diameter of 4.8 cm (range, 3.0-6.5 cm) and a mean maximum ablation zone volume of 15.1 cm(3) (range, 7.3-25.1 cm(3)). At hematoxylin-eosin staining, coagulation necrosis was observed in all ablation zones, extended into the normal lung in nine of 10 specimens, and up to blood vessel walls without evidence of vessel (>4 mm) thrombosis. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide staining enabled confirmation of no viability within ablation zones extending into normal lung in five of six specimens. CONCLUSION: MWA with tumor permittivity feedback control results in cytotoxic intratumoral temperatures and extension of ablation zones into aerated peritumoral pulmonary parenchyma, possibly forming the equivalent of an oncologic resection margin.
