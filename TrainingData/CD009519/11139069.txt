Extensive F-18 FDG uptake in metastatic spindle cell carcinoma of the lung.
A 77-year-old man with stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma of the lung underwent right upper lobectomy. One month later he was examined for right chest pain, dyspnea, cough, and weakness. A roentgenogram showed nondiagnostic diffuse opacification of his right lung cavity. An F-18 FDG positron emission tomographic (PET) study revealed extensive uptake in the right pleural area, left adrenal gland, right axilla, and soft tissues consistent with extensive local recurrence and metastatic disease. Biopsy of a right chest soft tissue lesion showed spindle cell carcinoma, a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma.
