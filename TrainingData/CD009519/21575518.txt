[Relationship between multi-slice spiral CT pulmonary perfusion imaging and the expression of EphB4 and ephrinB2 in non-small cell lung cancer].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of the expression of ephrinB2 and EphB4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and their relationship with multi-slice spiral CT pulmonary perfusion imaging. METHODS: Thirty-one nodules with pathologically proven NSCLC underwent CT perfusion scan. The perfusion parameters including blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), peak enhancement image (PEI) were collected. The expression of ephrinB2 and EphB4 in tumor cells and interstitial vasculature were detected by immunohistochemistry. Correlation analysis and trend test were used to assess the relationship between ephrinB2/EphB4 expression and clinicopathological features, and between ephrinB2/EphB4 expression and perfusion parameters. RESULTS: Positive expression of ephrinB2 and EphB4 in the NSCLC group was 83.9% and 71.0%, respectively, significantly higher than that in the internal control group (P < 0.01). The expression of ephrinB2 and EphB4 was consistently in tumor parenchyma but differently in tumor vessels. The expressions of ephrinB2 and EphB4 were positively correlated with lymphatic metastasis (P < 0.05). The expression of EphB4 was negatively correlated with blood flow (BF) and blood volume (BV), respectively (P < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between ephrinB2 expression and BF (r = 0.516, P = 0.003), and a positive correlation between ephrinB2 expression and BV (r = 0.448, P = 0.013). The expressions of ephrinB2 and EphB4 were not correlated with PEI (P > 0.05). The values of BF and BV in the high and moderate EphB4 expression groups were significantly decreased compared with that in the negative group (P < 0.01). The value of BF in the high ephrinB2 expression group was significantly increased compared with that in the moderately positive group and negative group (P < 0.01). The value of BV in the high ephrinB2 expression group was significantly increased compared with that in the negative group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The CT pulmonary perfusion imaging reflects the density difference of blood vessels with functional lumen, and such difference also depends on the quantity and quality of vasculature with functional lumen.
