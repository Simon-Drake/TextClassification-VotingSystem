Primary extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma of the lung.
Ewing's sarcoma is a neuroectodermal tumour characteristically presenting during the second decade of life and arising from bone. Extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma is exceptionally rare. We present a case of a 44-year-old man who underwent pneumonectomy for a primary extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma of the lung. This demonstrates a very rare pulmonary Ewing's sarcoma and highlights the importance of preoperative evaluation in aggressive tumours.
