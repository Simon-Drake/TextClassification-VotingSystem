Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in small-cell lung cancer: results of a multicenter study.
UNLABELLED: The aims of this study were to determine the accuracy of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in the detection of the primary tumor and its metastases in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in a large patient population, and to investigate the course of somatostatin uptake in primary tumors during therapy. METHODS: In a total of 100 patients, 134 examinations were performed. Twenty-seven of the patients were examined before and after chemotherapy. Planar whole-body images were acquired 4 hr and 24 hr after injection of approximately 200 MBq (111)In-pentetreotide. SPECT of the thorax was performed after 24 hr. Tumor-to-background (T/B) ratios for the primary tumor were averaged from anterior and posterior projections. RESULTS: Compared to conventional investigations, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) visualized the primary tumor with varying degrees of uptake in 96% of the examinations. Regional metastases and distant metastases were detected in 60% and 45% of the examinations, respectively. The uptake of the somatostatin analog by the primary tumor was significantly lower in the patients examined during chemotherapy as compared to those examined before treatment (T/B ratio = 1.94+/-0.79 versus 2.35+/-0.9, p < 0.005). A decrease in T/B ratio was noted in patients with remission at the time of SRS (from 2.40+/-1.56 to 1.63+/-0.72, p < 0.05). No difference in the pretreatment uptake of octreotide by the primary tumor was identified between patients with tumor progression and those with partial or complete remission. CONCLUSION: Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy has a high sensitivity in the detection of the primary tumor in SCLC but fails in the detection of metastases. Thus, SRS does not provide useful information for staging of SCLC. Since somatostatin uptake by the primary tumor is affected by chemotherapy, it may be used to follow up on the course of SCLC.
