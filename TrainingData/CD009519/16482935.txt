Large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine morphology of the lung.
We experienced a surgical case of large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine morphology (LCCNM) of the lung. A 76-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because a routine chest X-ray examination had revealed a nodular shadow in the left lung field. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in an area corresponding to the shadow. Transbronchial lung biopsy failed to give a definitive diagnosis, therefore open lung biopsy was performed because of suspected lung cancer. Needle biopsy was performed, and the tumor was diagnosed as large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma by rapid intraoperative pathological examination. As sampling of hilar lymph nodes revealed no metastasis, left upper segmentectomy was performed for severe obstructive pulmonary disease. Immunohistochemical examination finally diagnosed the tumor as LCCNM. The patient is doing well without recurrence at ten months after surgery.
