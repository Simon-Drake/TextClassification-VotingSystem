Coexistence of two different types of lymphoma in a patient with Sjogren's syndrome. The usefulness of the PET-CT.
Sjogren syndrome is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease in which there is an increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Neoplastic lung involvement and the coexistence of different histological types of lymphoma are uncommon in these patients. These patients frequently have associated infectious processes, most of them due to oral candidiasis. When there is immunodeficiency, the hematogenous spread of the fungus may affect the lungs. We present the case of a female patient diagnosed with follicular non- Hodgkin lymphoma within the context of long-term Sjogren syndrome. In addition to the neoplastic nodal and splenic disease, the PET-CT study showed extensive lung involvement. Due to suspicion of a false positive result for pulmonary Candida infection, antifungal treatment was initiated, with no response. A further histological study showed the presence of a second and different type of lymphoma.
