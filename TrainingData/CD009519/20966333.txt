Stabilization of mobile pulmonary nodules during radiofrequency ablation.
OBJECTIVE: Lung tumors can exhibit a high degree of mobility during insertion of radiofrequency applicators owing to both respiratory motion and the inherent characteristics of pulmonary parenchyma. The purpose of this report is to describe a technique used to secure lung tumors during insertion of a radiofrequency applicator. CONCLUSION: As experience with percutaneous imaging-guided radiofrequency ablation increases, technical challenges become increasingly apparent. A technique whereby a mobile pulmonary tumor is anchored prior to placement of the ablation electrode is one method of overcoming such a challenge.
