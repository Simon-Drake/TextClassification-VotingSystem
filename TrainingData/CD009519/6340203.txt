Diagnostic methods in lung cancer.
We feel that the guidelines described here reflect the state of the art at the time of writing (April 1982). The role of CT scanning is likely to evolve further and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) will probably play a significant role in the future. Experience, expertise, and equipment will vary from one hospital to another and thus rigid rules cannot reasonably be applied for the workup of suspected lung cancer. Ideally the diagnostic approach to an individual patient will be highly tailored, not only in regard to the nature of the pulmonary lesion, but also to his or her overall medical and social situation. We have found that a policy of early consultation between clinician and imaging specialist most readily facilitates effective use of available diagnostic resources.
