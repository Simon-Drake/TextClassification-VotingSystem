Gefitinib in non-small cell lung carcinoma: a case report of an unusual side effect and complete response in advanced disease.
Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, indicated in advanced non-small cell lung cancer in all lines of treatment for patients harboring EGFR mutations. It has a favorable toxicity profile but may induce unexpected adverse effects, such as an infiammatory reaction in the bladder. We report a rare case of hemorrhagic cystitis, an unusual side effect, in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer treated with gefitinib, which did not compromise the clinical response.
