Factors causing inaccurate staging of mediastinal nodal involvement in non-small cell lung cancer patients staged by positron emission tomography.
Despite documented superiority of positron emission tomography over other investigative modalities in the preoperative staging of non-small cell lung cancer, a proportion of patients will have an inaccurate staging of their mediastinal nodes. The aim of this retrospective review is to analyse the clinicopathological factors responsible for inaccurate nodal staging by integrated PET-CT. A total of 100 consecutive patients with histologically proven non-small cell lung cancer underwent staging with PET-CT prior to lung resection. Thirty-three patients, inaccurately staged by PET-CT, were analysed. Univariate analysis identified the following as significant in causing inaccurate nodal staging: history of tuberculosis (P=0.039) and non-insulin dependant diabetes (P=0.014). In multivariate analysis, we have identified the following as independent factors in causing inaccurate staging of mediastinal lymph nodes: rheumatoid arthritis, non-insulin dependent diabetes, history of tuberculosis, presence of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and pneumonia (P<0.05). The highest rate of inaccuracy in mediastinal nodal staging was in nodal station 4 (11%, P=0.01) followed by station 7 (10%, P=0.02) and station 9 (3.5%, P=0.01). Interpretation of PET-CT staging of the mediastinum in patients with a history of the above should be with caution, as the incidence of false upstaging and down staging in these subgroups is high. Vigilance of such factors may improve the accuracy of PET-CT in staging mediastinal lymph nodes. Histological confirmation should always be sought.
