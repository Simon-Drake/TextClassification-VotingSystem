[A case of complete response in a primary lesion treated by gefitinib for two years after surgery of brain metastasis from lung cancer].
A 54-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for vertigo, headache and vomiting at the end of July, 2001. Under a diagnosis of cerebellar tumor and right lung tumor, she underwent a resection of cerebellar tumor on August 7, 2001. The histopathological diagnosis was "metastatic adenocarcinoma". Lung cancer was doubted as for the origin, however, she did not want further examination. The patient was given 2 courses of postoperative chemotherapy (CBDCA+VNR) and radiotherapy (50 Gy), and discharged. Gefitinib treatment was begun in September, 2002 at her request. The tumor marker was not elevated, and the tumor size on CT showed the tendency toward some reduction. Close examination including PET revealed no metastasis. The patient then underwent right upper lobectomy (ND 2 a) on October 8, 2004 at her request. Histopathologically, psammoma body existed but no cancer cells nor lymph node metastasis. It seemed that there was a complete response by gefitinib after 3 years.
