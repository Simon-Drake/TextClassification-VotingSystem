Radionuclide emission computed tomography of the head with 99mCc and a scintillation camera.
To investigate the potential application of radionuclide computed tomography (RCT) to nuclear medicine imaging using 99mTc, a tomographic system using a lightweight scintillation camera for brain imaging was constructed, and lesion contrast with RCT and conventional scintigraphy were compared. The detector revolves once around the patient's head at constant angular velocity, requiring approximately 20 min. Nine sections are reconstructed from the data, using either a Fourier transform or a filtered back-projection algorithm. In a phantom simulating the radionuclide distribution observed during brain imaging, quantitative lesion contrast was far superior in the RCT images. In a series of 25 patients with intracranial lesions, the average RCT lesion contrast was superior to that of standard scintigraphy by a factor of more than 2. An RCT image of an experimentally infarcted dog's heart, taken after the injection of 99mTc-MAA into the left atrium, also showed excellent correspondence to the gross anatomic defect. Although problems of photon absorption may occur in imaging larger body areas, RCT imaging in this feasibility study produced surprisingly good results that warrant further investigation of the technique.
