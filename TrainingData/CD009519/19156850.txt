A case of natural killer cell lymphoma presenting with bilateral pleural effusions and hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis.
Natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma of lung is very rare. We report a case of NK cell lymphoma presented in a 17-year-old male with bilateral pleural effusions and hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis. Morphologic and immunohistochemical tests revealed an association of NK cell lymphoma with Epstein-Barr virus. A literature review helped identify other cases of patients with NK cell lymphoma, their treatment and outcomes.
