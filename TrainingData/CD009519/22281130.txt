Malignant ameloblastoma: concurrent presentation of primary and distant disease and review of the literature.
Malignant ameloblastoma is a rare tumor of odontogenic origin with a metastatic focus. Distant metastatic disease is found most commonly in the lungs. A review of the literature shows that most cases of malignant ameloblastoma involve a disease-free period from primary tumor extirpation to the discovery of metastasis. This report describes the case of a 56-year-old man presenting with ameloblastoma of the maxilla and a solitary pulmonary metastasis concurrently. This represents a rare case in which there is a simultaneous diagnosis of primary ameloblastoma and a metastatic lesion. Appropriate workup for ameloblastoma includes surveillance for metastatic disease. Surgical resection of primary and distant disease is recommended. Chemotherapy and radiation may play a role in palliation when resection of metastatic disease is not feasible.
