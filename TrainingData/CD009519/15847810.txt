Radiologic evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule.
The solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is a common radiologic finding. There are different management approaches and the work-up often requires evaluation over a long period of time to establish a benign or malignant diagnosis. Comparison with old examinations and morphologic evaluation of the size, margins, and internal characteristics of an (SPN) should be the first step in the evaluation of these lesions. It is often necessary to proceed to additional imaging techniques and in some situations invasive tests or surgical biopsy may be required.
