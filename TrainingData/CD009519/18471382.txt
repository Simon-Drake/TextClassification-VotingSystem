[Solitary pulmonary nodules: detection, characterization, and guidance for further diagnostic workup and treatment].
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to improve radiologists' understanding of the clinical issues involved in making a diagnosis and to guide further diagnostic workup and treatment of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs). CONCLUSION: Information on the morphologic and hemodynamic characteristics ofSPNs provided by dynamic helical CT, with high specificity and reasonably high accuracy, can be used for initial assessment. PET/CT is more sensitive at detecting malignancy than dynamic helical CT, and all malignant nodules may be potentially diagnosed as malignant by both techniques. Therefore, PET/CT may be selectively performed to characterize SPNs that show in-determinate results at dynamic helical CT.
