Multimodality imaging features in a case of bronchial carcinoid including FDG PET.
BACKGROUND: Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are rare, low-grade neuroendocrine malignancies which comprise 1-2% of all lung neoplasms. Approximately 80% of carcinoid tumors occur in the central airways and present clinically as obstructive pneumonia or hemoptysis. Experience with F18 FDG PET to image pulmonary carcinoid tumors is limited. CASE REPORT: A 67 year old woman presented with two episodes of hemoptysis within one month. A whole body FDG PET scan was performed in addition to a contrast enhanced chest CT, a whole body In111 octreotide scan, and quantitative lung perfusion scan during the diagnostic evaluation. An endobronchial lesion was discovered and the patient underwent a successful resection of the right middle and lower lobes. The histopathology of the lesion was consistent with a typical carcinoid tumor. CONCLUSIONS: We describe multimodality imaging findings along with the histopathology and a review of the literature, focusing on the role of FDG PET in the management of patients with bronchial carcinoid tumors.
