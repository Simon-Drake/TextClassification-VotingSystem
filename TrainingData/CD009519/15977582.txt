[Surgical procedure of thoracoscopic and video-assisted anatomical segmentectomy for small peripheral lung cancer].
Recently, small peripheral lung cancers which is indicated limited resection are frequently found by HRCT or PET. The limited resection for lung cancer includes thoracic and video-assisted anatomical segmentectomy (VATS segmentectomy) and wedge resection of the lung parenchyma. In anatomical segmentectomy, intra-plumonary lymph nodes are dissected, on the other hand, those lymph nodes can not be dissected in wedge resection. Consequently, segmentectomy will be radical procedure for lung cancer compared with wedge resection. Thoracic surgeons are required to perform anatomical segmentectomy for small peripheral lung cancer. The anatomical segmentectomy is not familiar procedure for recent thoracic surgeons. Thoracic surgeons should be skilled in that procedures. This is a review of basic procedures of VATS segmentectomy for lung cancer for young thoracic surgeones.
