[Possibility of computed tomography in evaluation of locoregional invasion of non-small cell lung cancer].
UNLABELLED: Clinical prognosis and treatment schedules of non-small cell lung cancer are dependent on tumor stage. The objective of the study was to assess the diagnostic value of computed tomography scans in preoperative staging of non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: One hundred thirty seven case reports were analyzed retrospectively and 72 cases were found eligible for the analysis. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative prognostic values of computed tomography in assessing metastases in mediastinal lymphnodes were 0.79; 0.45; 0.34; 0.85 respectively. The overall accuracy was 0.51. When evaluating the direct invasion of the tumor to chest wall, pericardium and mediastinum the values were as follows: 0.56; 0.87; 0.59; 0.86; 0.76. The conclusion is made that the accuracy of computed tomography in evaluating mediastinal lymphnode status is not sufficient due to increased sensitivity and decreased specificity. The accuracy of computed tomography in evaluating direct invasion of the non-small cell lung cancer is tolerable.
