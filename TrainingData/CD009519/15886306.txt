New developments in lung cancer screening.
Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer in our society. Late diagnosis of this disease is a major problem and so recent favorable reports with spiral computed tomography screening of high-risk populations have rekindled interest in improving early lung cancer detections. The process of lung cancer screening is a complicated process that involves many component activities. Interest to date has heavily focused on the initial case identification, but more recent reports have suggested that the issues with case work-up and surgical management also bear closer consideration. Given the dynamic nature of spiral computed tomography scan development and the remarkable improvements in imaging resolution over the last decade, there is an urgent need for research to establish optimal clinical management of early lung cancer detected in a screening setting.
