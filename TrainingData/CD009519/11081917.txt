FDG imaging of a pulmonary artery sarcoma.
Fluorine-18-2-fluro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomographic tumor imaging was employed to aid in the diagnosis of a patient with a right hilar mass. Based on preoperative imaging and intraoperative findings, a right pneumonectomy was performed for what proved to be a pulmonary artery sarcoma.
