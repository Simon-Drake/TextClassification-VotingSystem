[Nuclear medicine in pneumonology in the light of 9 year's experience at the S. Luigi Gonzaga Hospital].
An attempt is made to draw a picture of the results obtained with nuclear medicine in the pneumological field in the light of 9 years experience. An attempt is also made to identify from among recently introduced techniques (T.A.C., echotomography) which ones might be substituted for radioisotopes and when, and on what occasion they can be used as complementary treatment. It is concluded that nuclear medicine is of absolute value for functional examinations of the respiratory apparatus (perfusors and ventilators) and for lung onconscannning with Ga67 citrate and Bleomycin-Co57 under present circumstances and that in other fields certain morphological scans (bone scans) are still useful by virtue of their cost-benefit ratio.
