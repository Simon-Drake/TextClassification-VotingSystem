Granular cell tumor of the lung.
A nodular lesion in the medial segment of right middle lobe was discovered on a chest radiograph for chronic cough in a 42-year-old Asian woman. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan subsequently showed a right middle lobe (RML) nodular lesion, which exhibited intense fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography scan. A thoracoscopic RML lobectomy was then performed and immunohistochemical study and Ki-67 proliferative index on the pathology sample demonstrated a benign granular cell tumor. Thirty-six months after surgery, the patient remains symptom-free and there has been no recurrence of the tumor on follow-up CT scan.
