Diaphragm perforation after radio-frequency ablation for metastatic lung cancer.
A case of diaphragm perforation after radio-frequency ablation (RFA) for lung metastasis from uterine cervical cancer is reported. The patient developed pelvic recurrence and solitary lung metastasis after a radical hysterectomy for uterine cervical cancer. Pelvic radiation and RFA for lung metastasis were performed. Metastasis was located in the laterobasal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. RFA was repeatedly performed in September 2005 and August 2006. In May 2008, (1)(8)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed evidence of local recurrence of the lung metastasis. A solid lesion with FDG accumulation accompanying a cystic lesion was observed in the lung base. The patient underwent a wedge resection of the lung in June 2008, during which a perforated area of the diaphragm (3 cm in diameter) was identified under the cystic lesion, which was not herniated. The perforation in the diaphragm was closed with a simple continuous suture.
