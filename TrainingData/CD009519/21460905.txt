Early detection of liver cancer based on bioluminescence tomography.
As a new modality of molecular imaging, bioluminescence imaging has been widely used in tumor detection and drug evaluation. However, BLI cannot present the depth of information for internal diseases such as a liver tumor in situ or a lung tumor in situ. In this paper, we describe a bioluminescence tomography (BLT) method based on the bioluminescent intensity attenuation calibration and applied it to the early detection of liver cancer in situ. In comparison with BLT without calibration, this method could improve the reconstruction accuracy by more than 10%. In comparison with micro-computed tomography and other traditional imaging modalities, this method can detect a liver tumor at a very early stage and provide reliable location information.
