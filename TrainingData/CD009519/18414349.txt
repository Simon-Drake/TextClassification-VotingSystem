Pulmonary typical carcinoid tumor and liver metastasis with hypermetabolism on 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET: a case report.
Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are generally hypometabolic on 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET). We experienced a case of pulmonary typical carcinoid that showed rapid growth and high FDG uptake at the primary site and liver metastasis. A 56-year-old man with hemosputum had a medical examination by his family physician. A roentgenogram and computed tomography of the chest showed a solitary solid mass on the right lower lung field. However, he had not been shown an abnormal shadow on a roentgenogram taken 8 months earlier. He had undergone fiber-optic bronchoscopy, but the cytological diagnosis showed no evidence of malignancy. After that, FDG-PET was examined and revealed hot spots in the pulmonary tumor and liver mass. A standard uptake value of this pulmonary tumor was 32.9 mg/mL, and that of the liver mass was almost the same value of pulmonary lesion. He had undergone a right lower lobectomy diagnosed as a typical carcinoid. Thereafter he underwent partial resection of he liver mass, and the histology was metastasis from pulmonary carcinoid. We first reported a typical pulmonary carcinoid that showed high FDG uptake at the primary site and liver metastasis.
