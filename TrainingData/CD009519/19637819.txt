[Assessment of diagnostic criteria for FDG-PET cancer screening program according to the interpretation of FDG-PET and combined examination].
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to establish the diagnostic criteria for FDG-PET cancer screening program of four kinds of organ (breast, thyroid, lung and colon/rectum) according to the interpretation of FDG-PET cancer screening program of the case with proved clinical outcome. METHODS: Among FDG-PET cancer screening examinations performed in two PET centers during 2003 to 2006, two hundreds of examinations with proved clinical outcome were evaluated. Interpretation of breast ultrasonography, thyroid ultrasonography, chest CT and fecal occult blood testing, which were regarded as combined examinations, were performed together with the interpretation of FDG-PET images. RESULTS: As a result of the interpretation, localized FDG accumulating site in all four organs should be recommended for further inspections. In addition, essential point for diagnosis was considered as follows; (1) check over the slight localized FDG accumulation with screening of breast region, (2) combine chest CT with FDG-PET for the evaluation of lung region and (3) check up the shift of FDG accumulation between early and delayed phase with screening of colon/rectum region. CONCLUSIONS: According to the interpretation results of this study, we establish diagnostic criteria of FDG-PET and combined examination of four kinds of organ.
