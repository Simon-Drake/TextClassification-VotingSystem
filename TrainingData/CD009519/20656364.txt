PET scans in radiotherapy planning of lung cancer.
Especially for non-small cell lung cancer, FDG-PET has in the majority of the patients led to the safe decrease of radiotherapy volumes, enabling radiation-dose escalation and, experimentally, redistribution of radiation doses within the tumor. In limited-disease small cell lung cancer, the role of FDG-PET is emerging.
