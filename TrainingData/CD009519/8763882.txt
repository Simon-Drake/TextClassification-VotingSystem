Measurement of hypoxia in human tumours by non-invasive spect imaging of iodoazomycin arabinoside.
Tumour oxygenation status in individual patients may be assessed using the bioreduction and linkage of 2-nitroimidazole markers to viable hypoxic cells in vivo with subsequent detection by conventional nuclear medicine techniques. Iodoazomycin arabinoside (IAZA) was radiolabelled with Iodine-123 and administered i.v. to 51 patients with newly diagnosed malignancies whose tumours were subsequently imaged by planar and single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) procedures. Quantitative analyses of radiotracer avidity were performed at 24 h post-injection and tumour-normal tissue ratios of greater than 1.10 were deemed positive for tumour hypoxia. By this criterion, the frequencies of hypoxia in small-cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck and malignant gliomas were 60% (9/15), 40% (6/15) and 0% (0/11) respectively. The correlation of positive IAZA scans with tumour control and survival in patients with lung cancer and head and neck tumours is currently under study. Preliminary observations in neck metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck tumours indicates decreased local control at 3 months post-treatment in tumours with IAZA avidity. This study concludes that: (1) 123I-IAZA can be administered safely and repeatedly as an outpatient routine imaging procedure in cancer patients during initial work-up and follow-up; (2) that retained drug can be detected by conventional nuclear medicine procedures in inaccessible deep-seated tumours; and (3) that this technique could prove useful for identifying those patients for whom hypoxia-directed therapy is indicated.
