Value of FDG PET in the management of NSCLC.
Metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (FDG) has been accepted as an important imaging modality in lung cancer. FDG PET may have important impacts on the management of lung-cancer patients, for instance by improvement of locoregional (mediastinal) and extrathoracic staging (unexpected metastases). Interesting findings have now been reported in the response assessment to induction therapy providing results of greater prognostic significance than that obtained by conventional imaging methods. In the field of thoracic irradiation, FDG PET may provide advantages in terms of reduced toxicity, treatment intensification, better local tumour control and increased survival.
