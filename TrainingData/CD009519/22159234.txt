Multiple synchronous primary tumours in a single lobe.
We present the case of a 70-year-old man with three synchronous histologically different primary tumours in the same lobe. He initially presented with an intermittent productive cough, dyspnoea and non-specific abdominal pains. Radiological investigation revealed three areas of high-intensity fludeoxyglucose uptake of varying size within the right upper lobe. He underwent thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy. Histological analysis confirmed the three lesions to be undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. The reclassification of the T descriptors of the tumour-node-metastasis staging of a lung cancer has lead to the transition of classification of tumour nodules in the ipsilateral primary tumour lobe from T4 to T3. In the case of our patient, this has lead to the downstaging of the tumour allowing consideration for surgical management.
