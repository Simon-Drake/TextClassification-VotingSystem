[Chilean experience with the use of 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography].
BACKGROUND: Clinical oncology is the main application of 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). AIM: To evaluate the first 1,000 patients studied with FDG PET in Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 1,000 patients (aged between 1 and 94 years, 550 females) studied with FDG PET, since 2003. All studies were performed in a high resolution Siemens Ecat-Exact HR (+). All reports were based on the visual analysis of three plane and three-dimensional images. RESULTS: Ninety seven percent of exams were done for oncological indications, mainly lung lesions, lymphoma, colorectal and gastroesophageal, cancer and breast tumors. Only 1% of patients had brain tumors. Non tumor neurological indications corresponded to 1.7%. Cardiac studies were only 0.3% and inflammatory process corresponded to 1%. The 5.6% corresponded to pediatric population. Six percent of patients were aged less than 18 years and in 50% of them, the indication was oncological, mainly lymphomas, brain tumors, endocrine cancers and sarcomas. The remaining 50% had a neurological indications, mainly for refractory epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: PET FDG imaging was effective in the management of diverse diseases of children and adults.
