Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radiotracers in oncology--utility of 18F-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-PET in the management of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
PET (Positron Emission Tomography) is a nuclear medicine imaging method, frequently used in oncology during the last years. It is a non-invasive technique that provides quantitative in vivo assessment of physiological and biological phenomena. PET has found its application in common practice for the management of various cancers.Lung cancer is the most common cause of death for cancer in western countries.This review focuses on radiotracers used for PET scan with particular attention to Non Small Cell Lung Cancer diagnosis, staging, response to treatment and follow-up.
