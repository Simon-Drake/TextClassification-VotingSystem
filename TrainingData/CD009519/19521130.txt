[Response judgement - conventional versus new methods].
New ways of evaluating treatment success among thoracic tumour patients are increasingly being used alongside more conventional methods. These new approaches include tumour regression grading, CAD volumetry (computer-assisted volumetry), determination of the tumour density and tumour perfusion as well as the use of positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) or other tracers. Increasingly, endpoints that impact directly on the patient's quality of life and tumour-related symptoms are becoming more relevant factors together with the objectively measurable parameters used for assessing treatment response. This contribution describes the potential value of new methods and end-points from the point of view of a pathologist, radiologist, nuclear medicine specialist, radiotherapist, thoracic surgeon, medical and pneumology oncologist, and general practitioner.
