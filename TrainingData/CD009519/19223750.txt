[Effective gemcitabine plus S-1 treatment in elderly non-small cell lung cancer patients with multiple bone metastases].
An 81-year-old man presented with right shoulder pain 10 months after surgery for non-small cell lung cancer (p- T3N0M0, Stage II b). FDG-PET revealed an increased uptake in the multiple bone and mediastinal lymph nodes, suggestive of recurrence of lung cancer. He was given combined chemotherapy of gemcitabine plus S-1 as first-line treatment. This regimen was performed as a phase I trial for an elderly patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and the treatment proved effective. No toxic events were observed due to this therapy, so he was treated as an outpatient for one year. He was considered to have good quality of life.
