Exogenous lipoid pneumonia with unusual CT pattern and FDG positron emission tomography scan findings.
We report a case of an exogenous lipoid pneumonia that appeared as a spiculated calcified mass on CT scan in which a positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed before histological analysis. The F-18 fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET showed a pattern highly suggestive of malignancy which, to our knowledge, has not yet been described. Similar to inflammatory and infectious lung diseases, lipoid pneumonia may be a false-positive case of F-18 FDG uptake.
