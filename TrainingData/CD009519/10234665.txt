Evaluation of abnormal regional ventilation in patients with lung cancer using three-dimensional display of dynamic 133Xe SPET.
Preliminary studies were carried out of regional ventilation in lung cancer using three-dimensional (3D) display of dynamic pulmonary 133Xe single photon emission tomography (SPET). Transaxial equilibrium and washout images were obtained from SPET data acquired with an acquisition time of 30 s using a triple-detector SPET system in 39 patients with lung cancer. After reconstructing colour-illuminated, surface-rendered 3D images of equilibrium and 3-min washout (WO3), a single 3D fusion display was created from these two different time-course image sets, in which the 3D WO3 image indicating 133Xe retention was visible through the 3D equilibrium image delineating lung contours. The extent of retention was assessed using the 133Xe retention index, defined as the ratio of summed pixels of the segmented WO3 data to those of the segmented equilibrium data. 133Xe SPET was highly sensitive and specific for the presence of regional ventilation abnormalities associated with endobronchial tumour or bronchial compression due to enlarged lymph nodes. These abnormalities were demonstrated irrespective of the presence or absence of secondary changes distal to the tumour on the chest computed tomography scan. The geometrically realistic 3D fusion display enhanced anatomic localization of the regional ventilation abnormalities compared to the information from multislice tomograms, and the 133Xe retention index correlated well with %FEV1 (r = 0.828). This topographic 3D display for 133Xe SPET allows better perception of anatomic localization and extent of 133Xe retention. It will be useful for assessing regional ventilatory function in patients with lung cancer.
