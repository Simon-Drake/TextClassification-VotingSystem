Metastatic adenosquamous carcinoma of the foot: a case report.
Metastasis of carcinoma to the bones of the foot is rare and carries with it a very poor prognosis for patients. Acrometastasis can be the initial manifestation of an occult cancer or widespread metastasis of a previously diagnosed cancer. A high level of suspicion and timely diagnosis are essential to the timely diagnosis and treatment of this condition. In this report, a case of metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma to the first metatarsal, intially diagnosed as acute gout, is presented.
