111In-octreotide uptake in granulomatous and tumor lesions in a patient with small-cell lung cancer.
A case of a patient with small cell lung cancer and right submandibular node enlargement due to granulomatous lymphadenitis is presented. Diagnostic procedures included: biopsy of the cervical node, transmission computed tomography of the chest, bronchoscopic examination and biopsy of the pulmonary lesion. The patient underwent 111In-octreotide scintigraphy (whole body and single photon emission tomography) which revealed both lesions. We conclude that granulomatous lesions are to be considered as a possible cause of false positive results, when octreotide scintigraphy is used to evaluate distant metastases in patients with known cancer.
