Pulmonary meningioma: false-positive positron emission tomography for malignant pulmonary nodules.
An intraparenchymal lung tumor exhibiting the histopathologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of an intracranial meningioma is described. The tumor presented as a solitary asymptomatic pulmonary nodule with increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography. After right upper lobectomy, benign psammomatous meningioma was diagnosed. There was no clinical or radiographic evidence of a central nervous system tumor, suggesting that this was a primary lung tumor. The authors describe a benign tumor that can present as a false-positive finding of positron emission tomography performed to evaluate a possible malignant pulmonary nodule.
