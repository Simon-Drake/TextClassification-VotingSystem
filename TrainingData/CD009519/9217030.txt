Thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography as an indicator of prognosis for patients with lung carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: The uptake of thallium-201 (T1-201) in malignant tumors is associated with malignant potential (metastatic potential and proliferative activity). The grade of accumulation of T1-201 in malignant tumors may provide information regarding prognosis. METHODS: A T1-201 single photon emission computed tomography was conducted 120 minutes after intravenous injection of 111 megabecquerel of T1-201 chloride. The authors calculated the uptake ratio to evaluate the degree of T1-201 uptake in the primary tumor. This ratio was compared with survival time and other prognostic factors. RESULTS: The authors studied 152 patients (125 men and 27 women). The group of patients with the low T1-201 uptake ratio survived longer than the group of patients with the high T1-201 uptake ratio (median survival, 58 weeks vs. 33 weeks; P = 0.0138 by the log rank test). The multivariate analysis confirmed that the T1-201 uptake ratio was an independent prognostic factor for survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the T1-201 uptake ratio provides independent and objective prognostic information for patients with lung carcinoma.
