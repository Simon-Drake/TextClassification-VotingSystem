[Imaging of an adrenal cortex carcinoma and its metastasis with FDG-PET].
We describe the case of a 42-year old female patient with a carcinoma of the adrenal cortex. The primary tumor was resected without residual tumor tissue; only two weeks later there was a new large tumor formation in the adrenal gland's bed. PET-investigation showed the large local recurrency, multiple lung-, and liver-metastasis, so that no further operative therapy was performed. FDG-PET seems to be suitable for diagnosis and staging of adrenal cortex carcinoma in one single examination.
