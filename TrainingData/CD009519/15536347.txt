[18Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (18FGT-PET) and lung cancer].
In pulmonary oncology, positron emission tomography provides metabolic imaging with a sensitivity and specificity of around 90%. Such results are of particular interest in the diagnosis of the benigness or malignancy of a pulmonary nodule, for the staging and the follow-up of lung cancers. Studies are ongoing to assess its interest in the appreciation of the prognosis and response to chemo- and radiotherapy.
