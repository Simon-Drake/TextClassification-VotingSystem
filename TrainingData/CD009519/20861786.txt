Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules: a case of incidentally detected diffuse cystic micronodules on thin-section computed tomography.
Minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules are common incidental pathologic findings but are sparsely described in the radiology literature. They are of uncertain origin and significance, but they can occasionally manifest as mild restrictive lung disease or as incidental micronodules on computed tomography. We present a case of multiple incidentally detected, randomly distributed, cavitating micronodules with pathologic correlation. Awareness of the rare presentation of this entity is important because it may simulate neoplastic or other nonneoplastic diseases.
