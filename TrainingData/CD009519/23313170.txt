Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and radiation sensitivity of the lung assessed with an objective radiologic endpoin.
BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the association between radiation sensitivity of the lungs and candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes implicated in radiation-induced toxicity. METHODS: Patients with lung cancer who received radiation therapy (RT) had pre-RT and serial post-RT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) lung perfusion scans. RT-induced changes in regional perfusion were related to regional dose, which generated patient-specific dose-response curves (DRC). The slope of the DRC is independent of total dose and the irradiated volume, and is taken as a reflection of the patient's inherent sensitivity to RT. DNA was extracted from blood samples obtained at baseline. SNPs were determined by using a combination of high-resolution melting, TaqMan assays, and direct sequencing. Genotypes from 33 SNPs in 22 genes were compared against the slope of the DRC by using the Kruskal-Wallis test for ordered alternatives. RESULTS: Thirty-nine self-reported Caucasian patients with pre-RT and >/=6 month post-RT SPECTs, and blood samples were identified. An association between genotype and increasing slope of the DRC was noted in G(1301) A in XRCC1 (rs25487) (P = .01) and G(3748) A in BRCA1 (rs16942) (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: By using an objective radiologic assessment, polymorphisms within genes involved in repair of DNA damage (XRCC1 and BRCA1) were associated with radiation sensitivity of the lungs.
