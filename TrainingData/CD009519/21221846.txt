Nested stromal epithelial tumor of the liver--liver transplantation and follow-up.
BACKGROUND: The nested stromal epithelial tumor (NSET) of the liver is a rare tumor entity which is being reported in young girls. CASE REPORT: In our 16-year-old female patient, we have performed a liver transplantation (LTX) for a non-metastasizing non-resectable liver tumor. The patient was tumor free in the follow-up. At 28 months postoperatively, we detected lung metastases in the F18-FDG-PET/CT. The patient died 37 months after LTX from progressive pulmonary metastases. CONCLUSION: LTX should not have been generally recommended for NSET. Further statements about the value of LTX for NSET will be possible only after evaluation of the course of the disease in a larger number of transplanted patients.
