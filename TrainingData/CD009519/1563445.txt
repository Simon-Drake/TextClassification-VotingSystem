Effectiveness of planar image and single photon emission tomography of thallium-201 compared with gallium-67 in patients with primary lung cancer.
A comparative study of planar images and single photon emission tomography (SPET) of thallium-201 chloride and gallium-67 citrate was performed in 38 patients with proven primary lung cancer to detect the primary lung tumour and to establish the presence of metastasis in the lung hilum and mediastinum. The findings of planar images and SPET were compared with the pathological findings after thoracotomy. It was shown that 201Tl studies were superior to 67Ga studies for evaluation of the primary lesion and lymph node metastases.
