[Managing small pulmonary nodules in head and neck malignant tumors].
The recent increase in the use of helical CT has produced a higher detection rate of small pulmonary nodules than in conventional CT application, and has presented a serious problem in their treatment. We carried out a retrospective study to identify a clinical standard in the management of those nodules in head and neck malignant tumors. The subjects were 108 in-and out patients (87 men and 21 women) with head and neck malignant tumors who received radiation therapy in our university hospital between 2003 and 2004 (ages ranging from 25 to 93 years; mean, 66 years). Helical CT of the chest was applied to 92 patients of the 108 (85%). We determined small pulmonary nodules as round nodules 5 mm or more and less than 1 cm in diameter, and observed them in 14 of the 92 (15%). Firstly, we compared nodule growth by dividing the patients into 2 groups. The nodules grew in 2 of 7 patients of Group I, where chemotherapy was not done or where chemotherapy was not effective on the primary tumor, and in 3 of 7 patients of Group II, where chemotherapy was effective on the primary tumor. Secondly, disregarding the effects of chemotherapy, we analyzed nodule growth: the nodules grew in 5 of the 14 patients (36%). Those small pulmonary nodules were all pulmonary metastases. When small pulmonary nodules are detected by helical CT, accompanying malignant tumors of the head and neck, and bearing in mind the probability of their growth of at least 36%, we should therefore follow them up carefully.
