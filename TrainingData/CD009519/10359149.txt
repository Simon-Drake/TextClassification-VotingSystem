Teniposide sometimes effective in brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer.
In a prospective study we have treated 13 patients with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer with intravenous teniposide, at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on days 1, 3 and 5 given every 3 weeks on an out-patient basis. Six of the 13 patients had previously been treated for brain metastases by surgery and/or radiotherapy. Seven patients experienced neurological improvement. Objective response was obtained in 3 patients (23%) (2 PR, 1 CR), and stabilization in 5 patients. Duration of response in the 3 patients with objective response was 16 weeks, 40 weeks and 80 weeks, respectively. In 2 of these patients extracranial disease responded also to teniposide therapy. Although toxicity of teniposide therapy was relatively mild, there was one patient who died as a consequence of leukopenic sepsis. The results demonstrate that teniposide has some activity in de novo as well as recurrent brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer.
