Pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma: pitfalls in management.
Pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma is a rare benign tumor for which surgical excision is curative with an excellent prognosis. It often mimics malignancy, making it a diagnostic and management challenge. We reviewed the clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics as well as the surgical management of our patients to assess the potential pitfalls in management. All 19 patients who underwent surgical biopsy between January 1999 and December 2009 with a final histopathological diagnosis of pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma were reviewed retrospectively. The median age was 48 years, 89.5% were female, 89.5% were Chinese, and 68.4% were asymptomatic. There were no specific diagnostic radiological characteristics; 1 of 3 patients who underwent combined positron-emission and computed tomography had a false-positive result. Preoperative attempts at establishing a diagnosis were successful in 20% of patients who had invasive procedures. Intraoperative frozen-section evaluation for pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma had an error rate of 25% and a deferred rate of 31%, resulting in nearly half of our patients undergoing unnecessary extensive surgical procedures. We hope to heighten awareness of this diagnosis, thereby increasing the index of suspicion and minimizing errors in diagnosis.
