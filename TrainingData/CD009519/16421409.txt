Solitary pulmonary nodule with growth and contrast enhancement at CT: inflammatory pseudotumour as an unusual benign cause.
Small (< or =10 mm) pulmonary nodules are frequently detected at modern chest CT. As most of these nodules are benign, non-invasive classification is required--usually based on assessment of growth and perfusion. Absence of growth and no evidence of perfusion, as demonstrated by lack of enhancement at contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, strongly suggest a benign nodule. On the other hand, growth with a doubling of the nodule's volume between 20 days and 400 days or enhancement suggest a malignant nature of the lesion. We present an example of a nodule with strong contrast enhancement and a doubling time of approximately 260 days, which histologically represented a benign inflammatory pseudotumour.
