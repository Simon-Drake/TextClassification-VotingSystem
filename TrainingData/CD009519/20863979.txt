[Pulmonary metastases from malignant meningioma].
INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary metastases from meningioma are rare and present with specific clinical and radiological features. The diagnostic and therapeutic management of metastatic meningioma illustrate the concept of orphan thoracic oncology. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 58-year-old male, former smoker, with a previous history of atypical meningioma and resected lung adenocarcinoma. During oncologic surveillance, a computed-tomography scan disclosed multiple well-defined homogeneous nodules in the right lung. These nodules were hypermetabolic at positron-emission tomography with fluorodesoxyglucose. Pathological examination of metastasectomy specimens revealed metastatic malignant meningioma. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary metastases may occur in malignant meningioma. Twenty-one cases have been reported over the past 20 years. As for all rare tumours, multidisciplinary consensus is mandatory, in the absence of evidence-based recommendations based on prospective trials or observational studies.
