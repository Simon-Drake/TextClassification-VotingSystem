(18)FDG-PET/CT for detection of mediastinal nodal metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis.
BACKGROUND: We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucos -e positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) in detecting mediastinal nodal metastasis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Studies about (18)FDG-PET/CT for detecting mediastinal nodal metastasis in patient with NSCLC were systematically searched in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Review databases from January 1, 2000 to July 26, 2011. A software called "Meta-Disc" was used to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity, speci fi city, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR), respectively. We also calculated summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves, and the Q* index. RESULTS: 20 articles ful fi lled all inclusion criteria (3028 eligible patients). The pooled sensitivity, and speci fi city with 95% confidence interval for PET/CT on a per-patient analysis were 0.719 (0.683-0.753), and 0.898 (0.882-0.912). Corresponding values for PET/CT on a per-nodal-station analysis were 0.610 (0.582-0.636), 0.924 (0.918-0.930). The Q* index estimates under SROC were 0.8464 and 0.8067, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: (18)FDG-PET/CT had more specificity but less sensitivity for mediastinal nodal metastasis in patients with NSCLC.
