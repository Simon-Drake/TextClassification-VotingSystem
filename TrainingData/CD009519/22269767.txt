Segmentectomy simulation using a virtual three-dimensional safety margin.
Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography (3D-CTA) is valuable for preoperative simulations for lung cancer. However, when using 3D-CTA alone, it is difficult to identify tumor safety margins, especially for a segmentectomy. We report 2 cases of primary lung cancer for which we performed segmentectomy based on preoperative simulations by 3D-CTA with virtual 3D safety margins. We found this technique easy to use for simulations and useful for safely performing segmentectomy for small tumors in lung cancer.
