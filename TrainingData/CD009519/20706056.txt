Chest wall and axillary lymph node FDG uptake associated with cancer vaccine therapy for lung cancer.
Cancer vaccines are now undergoing clinical investigations, and clinical trials of therapeutic cancer vaccines have been conducted mainly for advanced cancer patients. We experienced 2 cases of multifocal F-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in the chest wall and axillary lymph nodes associated with personalized peptide vaccine therapy for recurrent lung cancer. In this article, we report fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose -positron emission tomography and positron emission tomography/computed tomography findings.
