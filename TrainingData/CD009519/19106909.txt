[Nodular amyloidoma associated with primary pulmonary Malt lymphoma].
INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary amyloidoma is a nodular formation containing amyloid deposits, which can mimick a pulmonary carcinoma. Its etiologic diagnosis require the search of an underlying infectious disease, a connective tissue disorder or a lymphoma. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 73 year old woman, asymptomatic, presenting an incidental pulmonary opacity in the left upper lobe, associated with hilar lymphadenopathies, positive on PET scan. The patient underwent a left superior lobectomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Histologically, the nodule was composed of amylodosis deposits. It was surrounded by a dense lymphoid infiltrate. The phenotype (CD20+, CD5-, CD3-, CD23-) of the lymphoid cells, like the demonstration of a lambda light chain restriction permited to pose the diagnostic of pulmonary Malt lymphoma and to characterize the AL lambda type of the amyloidosis CONCLUSION: Association of amyloidoma and Malt lymphoma is a rare condition. The histologic diagnosis of lymphoma may be difficult in this case, the lymphomatous process being concealed by the volume of the amyloid mass. Therefore it is necessary in case of amyloidoma to search histological signs of Malt lymphoma and to confirm diagnosis by demonstrating a B clonality and a immunoglobulin light chains restriction.
