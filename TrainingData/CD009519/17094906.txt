[Mediastinal lymph node staging in non-small cell lung cancer: comparison between spiral computed tomographic findings and pathology].
BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Mediastinal lymph node staging in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is important to choose standard treatment plan and estimating prognosis. This study was to evaluate the clinical value of spiral CT in staging mediastinal lymph node in NSCLC through comparing spiral CT findings with corresponding pathology. METHODS: A total of 89 patients with pathologically proven NSCLC received spiral CT and mediastinoscopic biopsy. The spiral CT findings and corresponding pathologic findings in staging mediastinal lymph node were compared. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of diagnosing mediastinal lymph node metastasis were calculated. RESULTS: Compared with corresponding pathologic results, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of mediastinal lymph node staging with spiral CT were 58.9%, 70.0%, 60.5%, 68.6%, and 65.2%, respectively. The accuracy and specificity of spiral CT was relatively low in staging 4R, 5, 6, 7 lymph node groups; the false negative and false positive rates were relatively high in staging 4R, 7 lymph node groups. CONCLUSIONS: Spiral CT is a non-invasive clinical examination which may be used in staging mediastinal lymph node in NSCLC; however, there exists false negative and false positive rates. It should be combined with other investigations, such as mediastinoscopy, to assess a more accurate mediastinal lymph node staging.
