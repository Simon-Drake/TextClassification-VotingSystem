[Iatrogenic lung microembolism detected by 18FDG PET/CT].
We present the cases of two oncology patients: a male with Hodgkin's disease after completion of chemotherapy, and a woman recently diagnosed of melanoma, who underwent positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with 18F-FDG for therapeutic monitoring and initial staging, respectively. In both cases, hypermetabolic foci of 18F-FDG in lung parenchyma were found, without morphologic abnormalities in CT. These findings would have been consistent with lung pathology in the absence of any anatomic correlation. Combined PET/CT interpretation was of lung microembolisms probably originated at the injection site.
