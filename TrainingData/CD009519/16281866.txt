[Yolk sac tumor of the anterior mediastinum and pulmonary metastases; report of a case].
A 31-year-old female was clinically diagnosed as having a anterior mediastinal yolk sac tumor because of the elevation of the AFP (17,500 ng/ml), a large mass lesion (9 x 5 cm) in the anterior mediastinum and bilateral lung metastases. After 4 courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP), etoposide (VP-16) and bleomycin hydrochloride (BLM), the mediastinal mass reduced in size significantly and the serum AFP level reached within normal range. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed a weak uptake in the mediastinum, accordingly the operation was performed. The tumor was completely removed and there were no viable foci of the tumor in part of the tumor. After the operation, 4 courses of chemotherapy with carboplatin (CBDCA), VP-16 and ifosfamide (IFM) were performed. She is alive without evidence of recurrence in 5 months after operation. It was noticed that the serum AFP is a useful indicator for determing the chance of operation after chemotherapy.
