PET/CT in non-small cell lung cancer staging-promises and problems.
Integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has many advantages over solitary PET and CT, which has led it to become an increasingly established imaging technique in the management of many cancers. This article will review the evidence for the role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in non-small cell lung cancer staging, examining its strengths, weaknesses and cost-effectiveness.
