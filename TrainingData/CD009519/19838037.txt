[A case of recurrent pancreatic cancer with lung metastasis responding to S-1 combined gemcitabine chemotherapy].
The patient was a 54-year-old male. In July 2004, he underwent resection of the pancreatic body tail region to treat pancreatic body tail cancer. On histopathological examination, the stump of the extirpated specimen was positive for tumor cells. After surgery, 10 courses of therapy with gemcitabine hydrochloride(GEM, 1, 000 mg/m(2), 3-week administration followed by 1-week discontinuation)were performed, and follow-up was continued. In February 2006, local relapse was detected. Chemotherapy with GEM was administered for 1 year and 9 months. However, in November 2007, an increase in the recurrent lesion size and right lung metastasis were noted. The regimen was switched to combination therapy with S-1 and GEM(S-1 60 mg/m(2) day, continuous administration on days 1 to 14 and 2-week discontinuation; and GEM 1, 000 mg/ m(2), administered on days 8 and 15). After the end of the 11th course, PET-CT revealed the disappearance of FDG accumulation in the recurrent and metastatic lesion sites. During the treatment period, there were no grade 3 or higher adverse reactions. The patient is being treated at the outpatient clinic (as of January 2009).
