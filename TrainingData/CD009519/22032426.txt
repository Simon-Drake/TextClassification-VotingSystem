Evaluation and treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States; however, recent clinical advances may change this outcome. New data on low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening, and technologic advances in surgery and radiation, have improved outcomes for those with early-stage disease. Identification of driver mutations in lung cancer has led to the development of molecular targeted therapy to improve survival of subsets of patients with metastatic disease. These advances now allow for treatment of many patients with lung cancer with comorbidities or poor performance status who would have had limited options in the past.
