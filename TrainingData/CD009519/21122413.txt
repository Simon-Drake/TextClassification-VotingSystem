[Prognostic value of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of (18)F-FDG PET-CT for assessment of therapeutic response and prediction of patient outcome after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Forty six patients with histologically proven stage III NSCLC had two repeated (18)F-FDG PET-CT scans either one week before therapy and at the dose of 40 approximately 50 Gy. The SUV(max) and changes of the two groups were compared with (1) the therapeutic response and (2) treatment results and long-term survival. RESULTS: Of the 46 eligible cases, the pretreatment SUV(max) of the responding and non-responding groups was 7.59 +/- 3.14 and 14.72 +/- 4.67, respectively. The midtreatment SUV(max) of the two groups was 2.89 +/- 1.39 and 9.82 +/- 3.31, respectively. Significant difference(t = 4.74, P = 0.001;t = 7.23, P = 0.001) in SUV(max) was observed both before and during treatment. Furthermore, the percentage change of pretreatment and midtreatment SUV(max) was DeltaSUV(max) = 61.9% +/- 8.7% and DeltaSUV(max) = 33.6% +/- 9.0%, also with a significant difference between the two groups (t = 2.83, P = 0.007). In addition, the 1-year survival rate of the the responding and non-responding groups was 68.0% and 38.1%, respectively. The 2-year survival rate of the two groups was 64.0% and 33.3%, respectively, with a significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.043, P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET-CT is highly effective in detecting therapeutic response in stage III NSCLC patients. The analysis of percentage change of SUV(max) provides incremental value in early prediction of therapeutic response and patient outcome.
