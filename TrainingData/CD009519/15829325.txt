Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasound/fine-needle aspiration diagnosis of a malignant adrenal gland in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer and a negative CT scan.
Adrenal metastasis is only seen on CT scan is less than 5% of patients with otherwise resectable NSCLS, but this diagnosis has a major impact on treatment and prognosis. We present a case of a patient with NSCLC and an adrenal metastasis, which was diagnosed by EUS/FNA of an enlarged adrenal gland, who had false-negative CT scan for adrenal metastasis. PET was not performed. Prospective studies are needed to assess the incremental yield of EUS/FNA over upper abdominal CT scan and PET for detecting left adrenal metastasis in patients with suspected or proven otherwise respectable NSCLC.
