PET imaging for suspected residual tumour or thoracic recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer after pneumonectomy.
F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) was investigated in patients with suspected residual disease or intrathoracic recurrence after pneumonectomy. Patients were identified from a prospective database. Impact of PET on staging and patient management was assessed. Clinical outcome was used to assess appropriateness of management. PET was performed in 17 cases, either post-operatively (n = 8), or later for suspected recurrence (n = 9) in patients with good performance status and without extensive disease on conventional imaging. PET changed treatment in 10 cases (59%). In five patients (29%), PET changed treatment intent (curative versus non-curative) from radical radiotherapy (RT) to palliative RT (n = 1), or observation or supportive care (n = 3), or from palliative to radical RT (n = 1). In a further patient with unexplained pain, PET appropriately showed no evidence of disease. In additional five cases (29%), PET influenced choice of RT dose and the use of concurrent chemotherapy (n = 3) or target volume (n = 2). Patients without tumour or with limited disease on PET had favourable outcomes whereas those with extensive disease suffered early tumour progression. PET was discordant with conventional assessment in >50% of cases. PET may be valuable after pneumonectomy if the patient is being considered for adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy although specificity may be reduced due to post-operative inflammatory changes.
