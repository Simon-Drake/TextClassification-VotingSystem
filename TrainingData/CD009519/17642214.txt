[Micropapillary component in lung adenocarcinoma generated in emphysema].
We report a case of 72-year-old male of adenocarcinoma with micropapillary component of the lung. Though the hilar lymph node metastasis was eminent, primary site was difficult to identify by using computed tomography (CT). SUV max with positron emission (PET)-CT in the case suggested the lung cancer in the emphysematous lung and it became an operation. The pathology diagnosis of the excision lungs was T4 (pml) N1 (#10, 12u) M0 stage IIIB. It was generated in emphysema, and it seemed that an adenocarcinoma with micropapillary component that did typical progress.
