Weekly dose-dense cisplatin-epirubicin-paclitaxel administration with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support does not substantially improve prognosis in extensive disease small-cell lung cancer. A SICOG phase II study.
PURPOSE: The present study was aimed at defining the antitumor activity of the cisplatin-epirubicin-paclitaxel (PET) weekly administration with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support in chemonaive small-cell lung cancer patients with extensive disease (ED-SCLC). METHODS: Chemonaive ED-SCLC patients received cisplatin 30 mg/sqm, epirubicin 50 mg/sqm and paclitaxel 120 mg/sqm, weekly, with G-CSF (5 microg/kg from day 3 to 5) support, for a maximum of 12 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were treated, for a total of 354 cycles delivered. Eight complete (21%), and 22 partial responses (56%) were recorded, giving a 77% (95% CI = 61-89%) objective response rate (ORR). After 14 (range, 7-28)-month median follow-up, 24 deaths have occurred. Median progression-free and overall survival were 7 months and 11 months, with 1- and 2-year projected survivals of 45 and 24%, respectively. No toxic deaths occurred. Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 4 (10%) and 1 (3%) patients, respectively. Only one case of neutropenic sepsis was recorded, while hemorrhagic thrombocytopenia was never observed. Emesis, loss of appetite, mucositis and fatigue were the main nonhematological toxicities, being severe in 9, 8, 4 and 7 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The weekly PET combination with G-CSF support represents an active therapeutic approach in chemonaive ED-SCLC patients. However, both ORR and median survival does not seem substantially better than those achievable with a standard regimen. In view of that, and in consideration of the relevant nonhematological toxicity, this approach should not be pursued outside clinical trials.
