[Surgery of residual masses after chemotherapy in patients with testicular cancer].
Advanced non seminomatous germ cell tumours are rare diseases affecting young men. Advanced disease is curable in 80% of the cases. The primary site of metastases is the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Secondary metastatic sites are the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has dramatically improved the prognosis of germ cell tumours, but surgery, when applicable, remains a central part of treatment. Forty five per cent and 10% of residual masses contain teratoma or active disease respectively. Residual masses of pure seminoma are removed only when postoperative pet-scan evaluation is positive or when they have grown during the follow-up period. All surgical procedures must be performed in a reference center.
