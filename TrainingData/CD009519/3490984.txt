Better visualization of a lung tumour with 99mTc-DPD than with 99mTc-glucoheptonate or 67Ga-citrate.
A case of a squamous cell lung carcinoma detected with 99mTc-DPD, 67Ga-citrate and 99mTc-glucoheptonate (GH) is reported. The highest uptake was seen with DPD and the lowest with 67Ga. Emission-computed tomography was very useful in DPD imaging but gave less new information in GH and 67Ga studies in comparison to traditional planar imaging. The patient had been given both irradiation and chemotherapy, which might be the cause of good accumulation of DPD and rather poor accumulation of GH and 67Ga.
