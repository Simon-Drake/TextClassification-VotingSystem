[Lung cancer associated with pulmonary aspergillosis in the nodule of old mycobacterial infection].
A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital to examine abnormal shadow in the right lung in May 2009. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a nodule in the apex of right lung adjacent to the old shadow which was thought to be inflammatory and had been followed up since November 2002. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed significant accumulation of the isotope in the new nodule. Lung cancer was strongly suspected and the nodule with the joining lesion was surgically removed. Pathological examination revealed poorly to well differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma in the cancer lesion and aspergillosis in the necrotic and old fibrocaseous lesion. In the present case, lung cancer is thought to develop adjacent to the pulmonary aspergillosis.
