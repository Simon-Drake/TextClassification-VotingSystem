Quantification of tumor vascularity with contrast-enhanced sonography: correlation with magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose autoradiography in an implanted tumor.
OBJECTIVE: To correlate the quantitated tumor vascularity of implanted murine tumors as depicted by contrast-enhanced sonography with estimates made with magnetic resonance imaging and with estimates of the percentage of viable (metabolically active) tumor as depicted by fluorodeoxyglucose autoradiography. METHODS: Implanted tumors in 10 mice were imaged with contrast-enhanced sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorodeoxyglucose autoradiography. Tumor vascularity was estimated with each modality and compared with the percentage of viable tumor. RESULTS: Quantitated estimates of tumor vascularity with contrast-enhanced sonography closely correlated (r = 0.95) with estimates made by magnetic resonance imaging and with the percentage of viable tumor (r = 0.93) as depicted by fluorodeoxyglucose autoradiography. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced sonography accurately depicts tumor vascularity in these implanted tumors. Tumor vascularity correlated with the amount of metabolically active tumor.
