[A colon adenocarcinoma and a pharyngeal carcinoma incidentally detected by means of (18)F-FDG PET in a patient diagnosed of lung cancer].
It is not uncommon to find two or more tumors in the same patient, usually based on similar etiologic factors or the use of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. This occurs quite often in the case of lung cancer. In this sense, the positron emission tomography with (18)F-FDG (FDG-PET) is widely used for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. It is also especially useful in patients with solitary pulmonary nodule, bronchogenic carcinoma, head and neck cancer, colon cancer, tumors of unknown origin, lymphomas, etc. Its capacity to detect previously unsuspected second or third primary tumors has also been demonstrated. We report a clinical case showing how two synchronous cancers were incidentally detected in a 73-year old patient diagnosed with lung cancer and referred for (FDG-PET) study.
