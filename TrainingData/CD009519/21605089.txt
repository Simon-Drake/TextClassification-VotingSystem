Metastatic malignant melanoma and dermatomyositis: A paraneoplastic phenomenon.
Malignant melanoma has previously been reported with paraneoplastic syndromes including dermatomyositis. We report a case involving a 34-year-old woman who presented with a persistent skin rash over her neck and upper body, with clinical features suggestive of dermatomyositis. The patient had a history of a right shoulder lesion that was previously removed; a solitary axillary lymph node was detected on additional imaging and biopsy results were consistent with malignant melanoma. The following year, surveillance positron emission tomography scan detected a solitary lung metastasis, leading to a partial lobectomy and confirmation of further spread of the malignant melanoma.
