Colonic metastasis from primary lung adenocarcinoma: case report and review of the literature.
We report a rare case of a 38-year-old woman with metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma from primary lung adenocarcinoma detected by PET/CT. She underwent colonoscopy and adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the pathology report, which was the same as that for lymph node biopsy from a left supraclavicular lymph node. We used immunohistochemistry to diagnose primary adenocarcinoma of the lung with colonic metastasis. Owing to mutation in exon 19 of EGFR gene, targeted therapy was given to her with a prescription of oral gefitinib for 1 month as first-line treatment. It was chosen to further treat the patient with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As the patient was suffering from increasing coughing and sputum, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were subsequently cancelled. Since the general condition of the patient was relatively poor, Tarceva was therefore prescribed. The patient had lived for 5 more months since the diagnosis of metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma.
