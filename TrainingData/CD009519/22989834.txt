Pulmonary tumor embolism secondary to uterine corpus carcinosarcoma mimicking pulmonary thromboembolism.
We herein report a case of pulmonary tumor embolism caused by hematogenous metastasis that mimicked pulmonary thromboembolism in a 62-year-old Japanese woman with a history of uterine corpus carcinosarcoma. The case suggests that tumor embolism must be included in the differential diagnoses of respiratory symptoms in patients with a history of malignancy. It also illustrates the usefulness of such findings as beaded, dilated pulmonary arteries by computed tomography (CT) and high (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake by fusion FDG positron emission tomography/CT imaging for differentiating a pulmonary tumor embolism from pulmonary thromboembolism.
