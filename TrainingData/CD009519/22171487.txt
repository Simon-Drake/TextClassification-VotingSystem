[A case of Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in an elderly person with a necrotizing pulmonary bulky mass].
A 52-year-old man presented with a pulmonary bulky mass, fever and cough. Chest CT showed a necrotizing bulky mass 10 cm in diameter in the right lung lower lobe. Transbronchial biopsy and CT-guided biopsy of the tumor and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of the right hilar lymph node did not yield a definitive diagnosis, but the histological findings showed necrosis. We performed CT-guided biopsy of the part of the lesion where a high uptake of FDG-PET was observed. The histological diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The immunohistochemical findings were positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Because the patient was more than 50 years old and had no underlying diseases, he was given a diagnosis of EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of an elderly patient. The pulmonary manifestation of this disease as a bulky tumor is extremely rare. In spite of the presence of a bulky pulmonary tumor, the EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma contained necrotizing tissue, and it was difficult to obtain tissue specimens for histological examination.
