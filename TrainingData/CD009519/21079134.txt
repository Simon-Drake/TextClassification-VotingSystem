European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recommendations for planning and delivery of high-dose, high-precision radiotherapy for lung cancer.
PURPOSE: To derive recommendations for routine practice and clinical trials for techniques used in high-dose, high-precision thoracic radiotherapy for lung cancer. METHODS: A literature search was performed to identify published articles considered both clinically relevant and practical to use. Recommendations were categorized under the following headings: patient selection, patient positioning and immobilization, tumor motion, computed tomography and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission technology scanning, generating target volumes, radiotherapy treatment planning, treatment delivery, and scoring of response and toxicity. The American College of Chest Physicians grading of recommendations was used. RESULTS: Recommendations were identified for each of the recommendation categories. Although most of the recommended techniques have not been evaluated in multicenter clinical trials, their use in high-precision thoracic radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) appears to be justified on the basis of available evidence. CONCLUSION: Recommendations to facilitate the clinical implementation of high-precision conformal radiotherapy and SBRT for lung tumors were identified from the literature. Some techniques that are considered investigational at present were also highlighted.
