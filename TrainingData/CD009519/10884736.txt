Intravenous extension of lung carcinoma to the left atrium: demonstration by positron emission tomography with CT correlation.
Intravenous extension of lung carcinoma is rare. A right upper lobe bronchogenic carcinoma with unusually elongated intravenous extension to the left atrium was first visualized with positron emission tomography (PET) and then confirmed with dynamic CT. The PET appearance of intravascular tumour spread is striking, and presents only a short differential diagnosis.
