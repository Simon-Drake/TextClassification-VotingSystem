Squamous cell carcinoma of the hilar lymph node with unknown primary tumor: a case report.
We herein report a rare case of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) located in the hilar nodes with unknown primary tumor. A 56-year-old man underwent a thoracotomy under the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer with hilar nodes involvement. The tumor was found at the hilus and resected without pulmonary resection. The pathological diagnosis of this tumor was metastatic SCC in hilar lymph nodes. Examinations of the whole body failed to detect a primary site of the SCC. The patient is doing well with no clinical sign of recurrence 32 months after surgery.
