Detection of colon cancer with 99mTc-labeled bombesin derivative (99mTc-leu13-BN1).
Breast, prostate, and lung cancer have been successfully detected with 99mTc bombesin (99mTc-leu13-BN1), the radiopharmaceutical that our group developed from synthesis to diagnostic trials. Overexpression of bombesin receptors (BNRs) in colon cancer is well known: the aim of this study was to assess whether or not colon cancer can be detected with a 99mTc-leu13-BN1 scan. Thirteen (13) patients, 7 of whom with known rectal cancer and 6 scheduled to undergo endoscopic removal of polyps for suspicion of colon cancer, were studied with a 99mTc-leu13-BN1 scan. Dynamic, single photon emission computed tomography, and whole-body scans were performed within 1 hour, before discharge of radioactivity from the liver into the duodenum. Sixteen (16) of 17 colorectal cancer locations were detected with a 99mTc-leu13-BN1 scan with 94.1% sensitivity. Six (6) lesions were benign: 1 Crohn's disease, 1 polyp with mild dysplasia, 4 polyps with simple hyperplasia; 99mTc-leu13-BN1 scans were positive in two nontumoral lesions, Crohn's disease, and mild dysplasia and true negative in 4: specificity was 67%. Of the 7 patients with known rectal cancer, 5, who underwent operations instead of radiation therapy, showed lymph-node invasion on 99mTc-leu13-BN1 scans. Operations confirmed the scintigraphic staging. 99mTc-leu13-BN1 is taken up by colon cancer. Scans are sensitive, although scarcely specific. 99mTc-leu13-BN1 allows for node-invasion detection.
