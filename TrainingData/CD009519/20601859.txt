Erlotinib-based perioperative adjuvant therapy for a case of unresectable stage IIIA (N2) nonsmall cell lung cancer.
Treatment of unresectable nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains challenging. The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are promising for patients with aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor activation in tumors. However, little is known whether erlotinib alone could benefit patients with advanced NSCLC. Here, the authors reported a case in which erlotinib alone stabilized stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC, leading to curative resection of lung tumors and invaded mediastinal lymph nodes. After lobectomy, the patient was followed up for 11 months without tumor recurrence. They also briefly reviewed recent literatures and discussed the implication of our findings in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.
