Synchronous sclerosing haemangiomas of the lung: an unusual presentation of a rare tumour.
Pulmonary sclerosing haemangioma is a rare lung tumour with a preponderance for Asian oriental women. Typically a well-circumscribed, solitary lesion with benign characteristics, there are concerns of malignant potential including regional lymph node metastases. Four histological subtypes exist. Diagnosis can be challenging as patients are usually asymptomatic and radiological findings are non-specific. Surgical resection alone is diagnostic and therapeutic. We present a case of this rare tumour with an uncommon presentation as two synchronous tumours initially misdiagnosed as a pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
