Diagnosis of recurrent lung cancer in the mediastinum using endosonographically guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy.
Endoscopic sonography is a well-established tool for the diagnosis and staging of gastrointestinal malignancies. It has been found to be of increasing utility in the diagnosis and management of lung cancers. We report a case of recurrent lung cancer presenting 4 years after initial diagnosis and treatment, in which endoscopic sonography was used to guide the fine-needle aspiration biopsy.
