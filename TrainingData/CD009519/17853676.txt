[Ground-glass opacity and mixed pulmonary nodules: a new computed tomography semiology of the pulmonary adenocarcinoma].
Recently a new computed tomography semiology of the pulmonary adenocarcinoma was highlighted. Studies on ground-glass nodule and on mixed nodule showed the relation between these radiological images and the different anatomopathological forms of lung adenocarcinoma. Ground-glass opacity can correspond to precancerous lesions and morphological characteristics of nodules are correlated with the prognosis. The presence of spiculation, pleural retraction and air bronchogram is significantly more important in neoplasic lesions. The presence or the apparition of a solid component inside the nodule or the presence of indentation is highly suggestive of adenocarcinoma. A lesion smaller than 20 mm and persistant after 1 month must be, either followed up, or removed by a limited surgical resection. Lesions larger than 20 mm or associated with a solid component must be treated by conventional surgery.
