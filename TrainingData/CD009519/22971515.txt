Primary paraganglioma of the lung: a case report and literature review.
Only 22 cases of primary pulmonary paraganglioma have been reported previously. This report presents a case of paraganglioma that arose in the lung of a 38-year-old woman who presented with chest pain and paroxysmal cough with little sputum. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan demonstrated two homogeneous masses in the left lower lobe accompanied by multiple mediastinal lymph node metastases. After resection, gross pathological examination confirmed two solid masses, which had a yellow-grey complexion and decreased blood supply and that invaded the mediastinum. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of several biological tumour markers. This is the first known report to describe the computed tomography imaging characteristics of a paraganglioma, thereby improving understanding of its morphological features and helping in the differential diagnosis of lung tumours.
