Frameless image-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung tumors with 4-dimensional computed tomography or 4-dimensional positron emission tomography/ computed tomography.
BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To augment the accuracy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), a variety of image guidance systems are used for patient positioning and target localization. Clinical outcomes evaluating these systems, especially frameless image-guided systems, are still limited. This article aims to describe and evaluate our frameless image-guided SBRT technique for lung tumors. METHODS: Between 2007 and 2009, 85 pulmonary tumors (50 primaries and 35 metastases) were treated with SBRT using daily image guidance for patient positioning and target localization in lieu of a body frame. Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) or an in-house protocol for integrated 4D positron emission computed tomography (4DPET/CT) was used for planning simulation. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 17 months (range, 4-42). Median overall survival (OS) was 31 months (95% CI, 26-34), and median local failure-free survival was 30 months (95% CI, 18-32). At last follow-up, 9 of 83 evaluable lesions failed locally. Actuarial local control at 24 months was 87% (95% CI, 75-98) and was significantly worse for metastatic lesions (95% vs. 74%; P = .045; log-rank test). No acute or late toxicities (grade >/= 4) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Frameless image-guided SBRT is a feasible, safe, and effective treatment for lung tumors.
