PET/CT in oncology: for which tumours is it the reference standard?
Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has a growing role in the imaging of many cancers. As our experience has grown over the past number of years so has our understanding for which cancers it is particularly useful. The value of PET/CT at each stage of the cancer journey is different for each cancer. This review attempts to tease out the role of PET/CT in the common cancers with particular emphasis on where it is the imaging investigation of choice.
