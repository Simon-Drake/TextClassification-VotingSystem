Teflon-induced granuloma: a source of false positive positron emission tomography and computerized tomography interpretation.
Patients diagnosed with malignancy often undergo combined positron emission tomography (PET) and computerized tomography (CT) to investigate possible metastases. This report presents a case in which, in the investigation of suspected pulmonary malignancy, combined PET and CT images suggested a malignant lesion at the level of the vocal fold. Biopsy of the lesion, however, confirmed the clinical diagnosis of a Teflon granuloma. The case highlights the potential for a false positive report during scanning of patients who have had vocal fold injection.
