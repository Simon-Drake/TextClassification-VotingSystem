[Multi-slice spiral CT pulmonary perfusion imaging and the expression of VEGF/PCNA in non-small cell lung cancer].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/ proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and multi-slice spiral computer tomography (MSCT) perfusion imaging. METHODS: Sixty-one patients who underwent CT perfusion scan by 16-slice spiral CT were examined. Among them,22 were brought into our research after surgery. The corresponding layers of tumor tissue specimens to the layer of CT perfusion scan were selected to determine the expression of CD34,VEGF, and PCNA. Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the relation between differentiation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the expression of CD34,VEGF/PCNA, and CT perfusion parameters. RESULTS: There was a lot of heterogeneity in VEGF and PCNA expression of NSCLC.The degree of differentiation had positive correlation with the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area CD34-MVD and the expression of PCNA and VEGF (P<0.05).There were positive correlations between the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area CD34-MVD and expression of VEGF and PCNA, respectively (both P<0.05). Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV),and peak enhancement image (PEI) decreased with the decreasing differentiation of NSCLC (P<0.05). The total CD34-MVD showed a positive correlation with PEI (P<0.05),and the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area CD34-MVD showed a negative correlation with BF,BV, and PEI (all P<0.05). The PCNA expression showed a negative correlation with BF,BV, and PEI (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: PCNA and VEGF expression in NSCLC regulates angiogenesis and proliferation at the same time. Perfusion parameters reflect the expression of microvascular architecture phenotype, and exactly evaluate the malignant degree of tumor.
