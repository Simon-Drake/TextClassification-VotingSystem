Unusual short-term complete response to two regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy in a patient with poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
CONTEXT: Treatment modalities for progressive iodine-refractory poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas are not yet well defined. Molecular targeted therapy with multikinase inhibitors has recently shown promising results, and cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally considered of low efficacy. OBJECTIVE: We report the case of a 57-yr-old woman with an advanced iodine-refractory poorly differentiated thyroid cancer who was treated sequentially between October 2006 and March 2011 with two different regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy and three lines of multikinase inhibitors. METHODS: Efficacy and adverse effects of the consecutive treatment modalities, i.e. vandetanib, doxorubicin-cisplatin combination, sorafenib, paclitaxel-carboplatin combination, and sunitinib, are reported. RESULTS: The patient presented a complete tumor response to a doxorubicin-cisplatin combination lasting 10 months and to a paclitaxel-carboplatin regimen lasting 5 months and had no or limited response to kinase inhibitors, i.e. progression after 3 months of vandetanib, progression after 4 months of sorafenib, and stable disease for 8 months with sunitinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: When tumor progresses with kinase inhibitors, cytotoxic chemotherapy may be an alternative in selected cases of advanced iodine-refractory poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. For those rare cases, clinical management should benefit from a multidisciplinary team approach through specialized networks.
