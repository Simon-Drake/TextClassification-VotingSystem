Late pulmonary artery stump thrombosis with post embolic pulmonary hypertension after pneumonectomy.
Ten years after right pneumonectomy for primary lung cancer, a 51 year old man developed a pulmonary artery stump thrombosis which produced microemboli in the remaining lung and, in turn, led to chronic pulmonary hypertension. This case strongly suggests that prolonged postoperative thromboembolic prophylaxis should be considered in patients undergoing right pneumonectomy.
