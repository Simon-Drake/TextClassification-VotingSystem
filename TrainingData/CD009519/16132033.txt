[Effectiveness of deep breath-hold SPECT in torso area: examination concerning improvement of resolution].
Because SPECT images are acquired under normal respiration, the respiratory motion induces artifacts and decreases resolution. In this study we developed a novel method of acquiring SPECT data during deep inhalation breath-hold (BrST) and assessed its efficacy in reducing motion artifacts and improving resolution. Reproducibility studies found that variations in SPECT image homogeneity were reduced using the BrST method to within a clinically non-problematic range. An experiment using a custom-built respiration phantom showed almost complete elimination of motion artifacts and significant improvement in resolution using the BrST method. Clinical assessment confirmed a significant reduction in motion artifacts along with the improvement in resolution. The BrST method enabled visualization of lesions that previously had been impossible to detect by standard acquisition under normal respiration. The BrST method is expected to both significantly reduce motion artifacts and improve resolution.
