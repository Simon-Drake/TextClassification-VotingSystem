Positron emission tomography: a false negative result in cystic encephalic mestastases from a small cell bronchial carcinoma.
Lung cancer represents one of the most common malignant diseases. Many investigations are used in the staging study including, most recently, PET. We present a case of cystic cerebral metastases (with no oedema) from a small cell carcinoma which were not detected by PET.
