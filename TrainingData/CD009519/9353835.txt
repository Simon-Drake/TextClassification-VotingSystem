Pulmonary endodermal tumor resembling fetal lung: report of a case in a 14-year-old girl.
This report describes the clinical and histologic features of a pulmonary tumor in a 14-year-old girl that is most consistent with a rare entity described in the literature as "pulmonary endodermal tumor resembling fetal lung" (PET). This tumor is composed of glycogen-rich columnar cells forming complex glands with focal festooning and mitotic activity, admixed with solid "morules" of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and focal nuclear clearing. Patchy tumor necrosis and a bland stroma were also present. Immunoreactivity for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and 12E7 was present in glandular cells and for human chorionic gondatropin (HCG), alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and 12E7 in morular cells. Ultrastructural features are those of an epithelial tumor. Related entities have been called "pulmonary blastoma lacking sarcomatous elements" and "adenocarcinoma of fetal lung type." Most cases of PET have occurred in adults, and the histologic features thought to have prognostic significance in small published series are applied to our case, in which the patient remains well and without evidence of tumor recurrence or metastasis for 28 months following local resection as the sole treatment.
