Metabolic profiling identifies lung tumor responsiveness to erlotinib.
A subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, bronchioalveolar adenocarcinoma (BAC), is more prevalent in Asian female non-smokers, and is more likely to respond to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of extracts from two different lung lesions and surrounding non-cancerous tissues of a BAC patient showed novel protein and phospholipid-associated metabolic differences that correlated with tumor development as well as PET and erlotinib sensitivity.
