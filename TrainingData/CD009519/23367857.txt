[The operated case of 89 year-old patient with pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung].
A-89-year-old male patient who complained dry cough was detected lung mass of 3 cm size in diameter at the right upper lobe by CT. FDG-PET seemed to show hilar and mediastinum lymph nodes metastasis. After three weeks, the mass showed rapid growth with 5 cm diameter in size at CT. Therefore the original tumor was supposed to be undifferentiated carcinoma, above all, pleomorphic carcinoma. He had been done pulmonary resection after short period. The right upper lobectomy with combined resection of the partial middle lobe was performed. Hilar and mediastinum lymph nodes dissection was added. In pathological examination, the tumor was proved pleomorphic carcinoma, however, no lymph node metastasis was recognized. He did not refer any complications and discharged back home at the post-operative 11th day. Pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung is known to be difficult to obtain definite diagnosis in early stage because of rapid growth. Therefore many cases are detected in advanced stage. In addition, chemotherapy is generally not effective, so only operative resection seems to be useful. Our patient was 89-year-old, he tolerated the operation and was alive with no trouble during 6 months after resection. When complete resection seems to be possible, operation should be regarded as an initial treatment.
