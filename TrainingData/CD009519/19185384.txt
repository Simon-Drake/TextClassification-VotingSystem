Necessity of centralisation of EBUS.
In the study of Bauwens et al. endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was provocated as first step procedure in the staging of PET mediastinal hot spots in lung cancer patients. In case of negative findings a surgical procedure should be undertaken. We certainly agree that in case of a negative finding a surgical procedure should be performed, however, we disagree that the first step procedure should be EBUS. In our opinion the first step procedure in a standard clinical practice should be a standard transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA).
