[Solitary lung metastasis after radical prostatectomy].
Prostate carcinoma is diagnosed in earlier phases of its evolution, but this carcinoma may have an unpredictible evolution. Radical treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) is the best treatment in clinically localized tumors. The biochemical failure over 5 years from the surgery is 20-50% of the patients; the biochemical failure over 10 years from the surgery is less frequent because of prognostic factors from the biologic nature of the tumor. We report a case with biochemical and clinical failure over 10 years from the surgery.
