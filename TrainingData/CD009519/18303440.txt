An unexpected abdominal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) in a patient with limited stage small cell lung cancer.
We report the case of an unexpected 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lesion in the right lower abdomen in a patient with otherwise "very limited" (T1N0) small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Additional imaging and endoscopic studies showed no abnormality. The patient was treated for presumed very limited disease SCLC, with resection, adjuvant chemotherapy, and prophylactic brain irradiation. Follow-up fusion positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed an unusual SCLC complication.
