Metastatic pulmonary pheochromocytomas: positive I-123 MIBG SPECT with negative I-131 MIBG and equivocal I-123 MIBG planar imaging.
Pulmonary metastases from malignant pheochromocytoma were seen with I-123 MIBG SPECT in a 16-year-old girl but were not visualized with I-123 MIBG planar imaging. She had a left adrenalectomy for a pheochromocytoma 7 years earlier. Two small pulmonary nodules were seen on chest X-ray and CT scans.
