Tc-99m MIBI thoracic SPECT for the detection of intrathoracic tumor masses.
Thirty-one men (age range, 46-76 years; mean age, 64.8 years) with intrathoracic masses suggesting possible malignancy on the basis of chest radiography or CT underwent preoperative Tc-99m MIBI SPECT examinations. Diagnosis was confirmed on pathologic examinations of samples obtained either at thoracotomy, esophagectomy, or by biopsy. Twenty-five patients had primary lung cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. Two patients had lymphomas with spread to the mediastinum, and three patients had extrathoracic primary cancers (one squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus, one squamous cell carcinoma originating from a head and neck tumor, and one metastatic mediastinal leiomyosarcoma). One patient with a tuberculoma had negative results of the Tc-99m MIBI examination. Tc-99m MIBI had a 86.7% sensitivity rate, a 0% false-positive rate, and a 100% positive predictive value to detect malignant intrathoracic masses. There was a 13% false-negative rate, however, suggesting that MIBI-SPECT may underdiagnose malignant lesions. SPECT findings of these 31 patients can be classified as 1) mass with increased uptake, n = 23; 2) ring-like appearance of increased uptake, n = 3; 3) mass with absent uptake, n = 4; and 4) photon-deficient mass, n = 1. Absent uptake in patients with mass lesions could be explained by necrosis of the lesion (caseation necrosis or massive tumor necrosis with or without bleeding). Most malignant intrathoracic masses are Tc-99m MIBI avid and may be detected with a high degree of sensitivity and with an excellent positive predictive value. A positive MIBI scan may help in the clinical diagnosis of malignancy. The use of Tc-99m MIBI could serve not only as a tumor imaging agent, but also may be used to determine the extent of spread and potentially the chemotherapeutic responsiveness of a tumor.
