[Pulmonary squamous papilloma].
We report a rare case of pulmonary squamous papilloma. A 42-year-old woman was referred to our hospital complaining of dry cough. A chest computed tomography (CT) showed a mass shadow in the lower lobe of left lung. Serum concentrations of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen (SCC) were elevated to 13.0 ng/ml and 11.8 ng/ml, respectively. The mass was positron emission tomography( PET)-positive, with a maximum standard uptake value( SUVmax) of 11.55, suggesting a malignant neoplasm. Under the guidance of video-assisted thoracoscopy, left basal segmentectomy was performed. Intra-operative diagnosis was a squamous papilloma and no malignancy. Her postoperative course was uneventful. She is currently alive without any sign of recurrence.
