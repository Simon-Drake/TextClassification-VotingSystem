Positron emission tomography in urological malignancy.
Positron emission tomography is a unique imaging modality with the capability of studying regional metabolism. The major clinical applications of positron emission tomography have been in the detection of brain, breast, cardiac, lung and colorectal tumours, as well as the evaluation of coronary artery disease by imaging the metabolism of heart muscle. In the field of urology, positron emission tomography has been evaluated in the relevant malignancies with promising results in certain areas and disappointing results in others. This article attempts to summarize recent advances in positron emission tomography scanning with regards to urological malignancy. At this stage positron emission tomography scanning is capable of visualizing urological tumours and associated lymph nodes and distal metastatic sites. However, its use is severely limited by the excretion of the most commonly used radioisotope via the urinary tract, making pelvic imaging particularly unrewarding. It is, however, undoubtedly capable of diagnosing malignancy in soft tissue masses or lymph nodes before these changes become apparent on conventional cross-sectional imaging modalities (computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging). Larger studies are required before it can be advocated for clinical use in the field of urology.
