Current status of stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung cancer.
Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for extracranial tumors has been recently performed to treat lung and liver cancers, and has subsequently been named stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). The advantages of hypofractionated radiotherapy for treating lung tumors are a shortened treatment course that requires fewer trips to the clinic than a conventional program, and the adoption of a smaller irradiated volume allowed by greater setup precision. This treatment is possible because the lung and liver are considered parallel organs at risk. The preliminary clinical results, mostly reported on lung cancer, have been very promising, including a local control rate of more than 90%, and a relatively low complication rate. The final results of a few clinical trials are awaited. SBRT may be useful for the treatment of stage I lung tumors.
