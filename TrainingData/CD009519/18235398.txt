[New technologies in lung cancer radiotherapy].
Since ten years, lung cancer radiotherapy improved thanks to capacities of imagery, softwares, hardwares which allowed developing and transforming drastically radiotherapy procedures. Improvements were performed in all steps of the lung treatment, immobilization, three dimensional imagery, delineation of the targets and organs at risk, simulation and ballistic, dose calculation, daily set-up, breathing control, and treatment verifications. Furthermore, new technology implies technical adjustments but also a change of physicians and physicists minds.
