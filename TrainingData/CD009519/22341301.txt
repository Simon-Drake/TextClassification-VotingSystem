Association of carcinoid tumor and sarcoidosis.
The association of systemic sarcoidosis with malignant neoplasms has been reported by several publications although there is controversy as to whether sarcoidosis predisposes patients to certain types of tumors or whether it is the tumors that cause a sarcoid reaction. The relationship between endobronchial carcinoid tumor and sarcoidosis is uncommon. We report the case of a 43-year-old male who was hospitalized due to hemoptysis. Thoracic CT revealed a pulmonary mass in the right upper lobe (RUL) as well as hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies seen with PET-CT. The endobronchial biopsies were compatible with carcinoid tumor. The patient underwent lobectomy of the RUL with mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Histology demonstrated type I endobronchial carcinoid tumor and sarcoid granulomas, both in the RUL surgical piece as well as in the mediastinal lymph nodes.
