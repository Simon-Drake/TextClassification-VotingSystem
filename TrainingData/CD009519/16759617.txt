[Contribution of PET in the follow-up of cerebral metastases in non-small cell lung cancer. A clinical case valuation].
We report a clinical case of a male 44 years old with lung adenocarcinoma with a single brain metastases treated with surgery and radiotherapy. The different PET studies performed during the evolution of the disease were very useful and crucial, firstly in the detection of radiation necrosis and after that when cerebral metastases recurrent appeared twice. The radiographic technique (Brain MRI) and the histopathology after the surgical removal confirmed the PET results. PET imaging is helpful in selected patients with brain metastases in lung cancer.
