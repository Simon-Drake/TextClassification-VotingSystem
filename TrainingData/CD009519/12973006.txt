Positron emission tomography and Paget disease: hot is not necessarily malignant.
The authors imaged a lung cancer patient with an enlarging solitary pulmonary nodule and incidentally found intense activity in the right proximal humerus consistent with known Paget disease confirmed via plain film and computed tomography (CT) without change in the CT appearance or symptoms during the next 7 months. The alkaline phosphatase and alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels were in the normal ranges. Their findings of high uptake with normal alkaline phosphatase and ALT are contradictory to previous reports. The authors present a case of Paget disease that appeared "hot" on positron emission tomography initially thought to be a malignant transformation that typically demonstrated high uptake.
