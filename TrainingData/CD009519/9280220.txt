Imaging of lung cancer: old and new.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Lung cancer is frequently encountered by the radiologist, whether the lung cancer is detected on a chest radiograph obtained in a symptomatic patient, or is an incidental finding. The radiologic workup of pulmonary lesions suspected of being lung carcinoma has evolved as new technology has become available. Current imaging modalities which are useful in the workup of suspected lung cancers include plain radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, with the recent addition of positron emission tomography and endoscopic ultrasound. The following article discusses the merits of these imaging modalities and their role in the workup of patients with lung cancer.
