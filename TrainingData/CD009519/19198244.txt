[A case of malignant lymphoma successfully diagnosed using Sasada transbronchial angled biopsy forceps].
A 68-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to general fatigue, fever and weight loss. His chest radiograph showed a nodule (2.8 cm) in the right middle lobe. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography showed multiple metastases to the bone, liver and lymph nodes. The lung nodule was not accessible by standard transbronchial forceps. However, biopsy specimens obtained using Sasada Transbronchial Angled Biopsy Forceps (STAF) pathologically confirmed the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. We report the case, and discuss the utility of STAF for lung lesions that are difficult to access with standard forceps.
