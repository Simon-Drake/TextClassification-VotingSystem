Probably anti-Tr associated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration as initial presentation of a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is the most frequent paraneoplastic syndrome affecting the brain. Until now, anti-Tr associated PCD was only seen in patients with Hodgkin's disease. We report a male patient who presented with a progressive ataxia, affecting predominantly the lower limbs and a cerebellar dysarthria. Extensive diagnostic approach initially showed no evidence of tumor. The patient was found to have anti-Tr antibodies in his serum. Fourteen months after onset of symptoms a whole body PET-scan showed a pathological focus at the right hilus of the lungs. A mediastinoscopy was performed and peribronchial node sampling was done. The anatomopathological analysis revealed a non-well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. This is the first report about the association between an anti-Tr associated PCD and squamous cell carcinoma.
