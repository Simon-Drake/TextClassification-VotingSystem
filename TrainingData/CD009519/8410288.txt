Comparison of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and carbon-11-methionine in head and neck cancer.
The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 2-18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is the most widely used tracer in oncology. PET tracer. Another radiotracer, L-methyl-11C-Methionine (11C-methionine), also has been used successfully for PET imaging of brain and lung tumors, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer and head and neck cancer. This study compared FDG and 11C-methionine as tumor-detecting agents in head and neck cancer. Prior to cancer therapy, fourteen patients underwent a PET study with FDG and one with 11C-methionine. Nineteen of 21 malignant lesions that could be evaluated were visible with both tracers. Tracer uptake was measured as standardized uptake values (SUV) and Ki values according to Patlak et al. The mean SUV in FDG studies was 7.7 +/- 4.2 and in 11C-methionine studies 7.7 +/- 2.5, whereas the Ki values in 11C-methionine studies (mean, 0.128 +/- 0.068 min-1) were always higher than in FDG studies (mean, 0.036 +/- 0.023 min-1). A good correlation was found between the SUVs (r = 0.79, p < 0.0001) and the Ki values (r = 0.82, p < 0.001) between the two tracers. Both FDG and 11C-methionine are effective in PET imaging of head and neck cancer, and the uptake rates of the tracers seem to be closely related.
