[Detection of pulmonary nodules with breath-hold magnetic resonance imaging in comparison with computed tomography].
PURPOSE: Evaluation of sensitivity and false positive findings of two fast MRI sequences for the detection of pulmonary nodules in comparison with spiral CT by two independent observers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All 30 enrolled patients had a spiral CT or MSCT as base line study. MRI was performed with a 1.5 T MR scanner (Sonata, Siemens) using a transverse 3D gradient echo sequence (3D-GRE: TR/TE/flip = 2.9 ms/1.1 ms/5 degrees ) and a half-Fourier single-shot fast spin-echo sequence (HASTE: TR/TE/flip = 800/25/150 degrees ) acquired in three planes. A separate analysis for both sequences was carried out prospectively by two independent readers (A and B) with different experience regarding pulmonary MRI. Additionally, a retrospective reading with knowledge of the CT scans was done. Results were calculated for all lesions and for lesions larger than 4 mm. RESULTS: The sensitivities were 73 %, 70 % and 84 % for the 3D-GRE sequence (reader A, reader B, retrospective reading) and 65 %, 68 % and 81 % for the HASTE sequence. For lesions larger than 4 mm, the sensitivities were 93 %, 89 %, 96 % for the 3D-GRE sequence and 85 %, 85 %, 96 % for the HASTE sequence. The rate of false positive findings depended on the reader's experience, but was generally lower for the 3D-GRE sequence with 2 and 16 (reader A and B) false positive nodules compared to 4 and 40 false positive findings for the HASTE sequence. The 3D-GRE sequence was more accurate for both readers (reader A: p = 0.08, reader B: p = 0.00003). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of MRI for the detection of lung nodules was only acceptable for lesions larger than 4 mm. The 3D-GRE sequence is superior to the HASTE sequence due to the reduced amount of false positive findings with comparable sensitivity.
