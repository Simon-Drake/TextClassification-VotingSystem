[A long survival case of advanced colon cancer with lung metastasis and cancerous pleuritis responding to CPT-11 and S-1 combination therapy].
A 71-year-old man underwent right hemicolectomy for an ascending colon cancer (stage II, Cur A) in September 2001. Adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur/uracil was performed, but CT scans and FDG-PET, conducted in May 2003, revealed cancerous pleuritis and lung metastasis. Although 2 courses of the chemotherapy with LV+5-FU (RPMI regimen) were completed, progressive disease was confirmed. Therefore, the chemotherapy with CPT-11 (100 mg/ day; day 1, 15)+S-1 (100 mg/day; day 1-21) was started in May 2004. After completion of 6 courses, CT scan showed a partial response. Only grade 2 vomiting was noted as an adverse reaction to the treatment, however, the patient has been managed on an outpatient basis for the last 3 years with good QOL and the cancer under control. This case suggests that this combination therapy can be expected to be highly effective as a safe approach for continuously maintaining the QOL of patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.
