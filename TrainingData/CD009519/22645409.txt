Molecular imaging of mesothelioma with (99m)Tc-ECG and (68)Ga-ECG.
We have developed ethylenedicysteine-glucosamine (ECG) as an alternative to (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) for cancer imaging. ECG localizes in the nuclear components of cells via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This study was to evaluate the feasibility of imaging mesothelioma with (99m)Tc-ECG and (68)Ga-ECG. ECG was synthesized from thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid and 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-amino-D-glucopyranose, followed by reduction in sodium and liquid ammonia to yield ECG (52%). ECG was chelated with (99m)Tc/tin (II) and (68)Ga/(69)Ga chloride for in vitro and in vivo studies in mesothelioma. The highest tumor uptake of (99m)Tc-ECG is 0.47 at 30 min post injection, and declined to 0.08 at 240 min post injection. Tumor uptake (%ID/g), tumor/lung, tumor/blood, and tumor/muscle count density ratios for (99m)Tc-ECG (30-240 min) were 0.47 +/- 0.06 to 0.08 +/- 0.01; 0.71 +/- 0.07 to 0.85 +/- 0.04; 0.47 +/- 0.03 to 0.51 +/- 0.01, and 3.49 +/- 0.24 to 5.06 +/- 0.25; for (68)Ga-ECG (15-60 min) were 0.70 +/- 0.06 to 0.92 +/- 0.08; 0.64 +/- 0.05 to 1.15 +/- 0.08; 0.42 +/- 0.03 to 0.67 +/- 0.07, and 3.84 +/- 0.52 to 7.00 +/- 1.42; for (18)F-FDG (30-180 min) were 1.86 +/- 0.22 to 1.38 +/- 0.35; 3.18 +/- 0.44 to 2.92 +/- 0.34, 4.19 +/- 0.44 to 19.41 +/- 2.05 and 5.75 +/- 2.55 to 3.33 +/- 0.65, respectively. Tumor could be clearly visualized with (99m)Tc-ECG and (68)Ga-ECG in mesothelioma-bearing rats. (99m)Tc-ECG and (68)Ga-ECG showed increased uptake in mesothelioma, suggesting they may be useful in diagnosing mesothelioma and also monitoring therapeutic response.
