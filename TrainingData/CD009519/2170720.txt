[Lung perfusion scintigraphy by SPECT--new application of bull's eye analysis].
The initial study reports the characteristic performance using lung segmental phantom filled in Tc-99m-pertechnetate. To evaluate the segmental defect in lung perfusion scintigraphy, we applied Bull's-eye analysis in addition to planar image set. Bull's-eye analysis especially facilitated the interpretation in both middle and lower lobes. Subsequently, to evaluate clinical application of Bull's-eye analysis, pulmonary scintigraphy was performed on 10 normal subjects and 60 patients with several pulmonary diseases. Of interest, Bull's-eye analysis, however, encouraged the interpretation in both lower lobes. To calculate the extension and severity of perfusion defect, the present study describes Bull's-eye analysis. Quantitative scoring showed higher in the patients with lung cancer than in those with pulmonary tuberculosis. The present study focus that Bull's-eye analysis can be useful of evaluation for perfusion in the patients with pulmonary a couple of diseases.
