[Oncologic imaging: indications for and limitations of modern cross-sectional imaging techniques].
Cross-sectional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) CT are an integral part of the modern oncological workup. They are used for tumor detection and staging as well as for treatment evaluation and monitoring. Due to pathophysiological and histological differences there is no universal imaging protocol for the assessment of different forms of cancer. For instance, CT is still the standard technique for the detection and staging of lung cancer supplemented by PET which aids the exclusion of nodal involvement and the detection of distant metastases. For hepatocellular carcinoma on the other hand, MRI is the preferred imaging technique, particularly when used in conjunction with liver-specific contrast media - PET/CT is only of limited value. Finally, for neuroendocrine tumors there is a focus on special radiotracers, which, in the context of PET/CT, enable a highly specific whole-body assessment. Thus, knowledge of the pathophysiological and imaging characteristics of different tumors is essential for a personalized, state-of-the art management of oncology patients.
