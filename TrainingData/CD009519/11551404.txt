Correlation of FDG-PET imaging with Glut-1 and Glut-3 expression in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.
PURPOSE: To correlate FDG activity on PET with the expression of glucose transporter proteins Glut-1 and Glut-3 in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Over a 5 year period, all patients with a PET scan and clinical stage I NSCLC underwent an immunohistochemical analysis of their tumor for Glut-1 and Glut-3 expression. The amount of FDG uptake in the primary lesion was measured by a standardized uptake ratio (SUR) and correlated with immunohistochemical results. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with a mean age of 66 years had clinical stage I disease. The final pathologic stage showed 64 patients with stage IA/B disease, eight with stage IIA disease, and one patient with pathologic stage IIIA (T1N2) disease. Glut-1 transporter expression was significantly higher than Glut-3 (P<0.0001), and although there was some association between the SUR and Glut-1 (P=0.085) and SUR and Glut-3 (P=0.074) expression, this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Glut-1 and Glut-3 transporter expression did not demonstrate a statistically significant correlation with FDG uptake in potentially resectable lung cancer. It appears that these transporters alone do not affect the variation in FDG activity in early stage NSCLC.
