Lobar mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung showing negative FDG uptake on integrated PET/CT.
We present a case of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma manifesting as air-space consolidation with negative FDG uptake on integrated PET/CT in a 42-year-old woman. To know this pattern of uptake especially in the case of mucin-predominant lobar bronchioloalveolar carcinoma may help avoid misdiagnosis of this particular tumor.
