Complete spontaneous remission of non-small-cell lung cancer: a case report.
Spontaneous remission (SR) of cancer is a rare event, particularly in lung cancer. We report the case of a 68-year-old man, who came to our attention with a diagnosis of poorly differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma and, in absence of any active therapy, underwent a durable complete SR. Our case supports the rare occurrence of SR in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
