F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scanning in the diagnostic work-up of a primary pericardial mesothelioma: a case report.
Primary mesothelioma of the pericardium is a very rare malignancy. The antemortem diagnosis is difficult and requires a multidisciplinary approach. The use of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography whole body scan has been recently advocated to improve staging and to monitor treatment in pleural mesothelioma. This is the first case describing the use of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the diagnostic work-up of a primary pericardial mesothelioma.
