Left upper lobectomy with combined resection of the distal arch aorta after chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced lung cancer.
We report a case of complete resection of lung cancer involving the thoracic aorta, after induction chemoradiotherapy in a 55-year-old man. The chemoradiotherapy, which consisted of two courses of platinum-based chemotherapy with concurrent radiation to a total of 40 Gy, resulted in a partial response. Left upper lobectomy with combined resection and reconstruction of the distal arch aorta and left subclavian artery was performed under cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient was given two courses of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, and there has been no sign of recurrence in the 34 months since his operation.
