Role of PET/CT imaging in stereotactic body radiotherapy.
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a relatively new technique that enables delivery of high doses of radiation to malignancies throughout the body with a higher degree of precision than conventional radiation modalities. PET and computed tomography are rapidly being adopted for the evaluation of patients with cancer, and its role in conjunction with SBRT is under active investigation. This article reviews the literature regarding the utility of PET and computed tomography in treatment planning, follow-up imaging, relationship with clinical outcomes, and other topics in patients treated with SBRT. These questions are investigated for cancers of the lung, head and neck, pancreas and liver. A brief overview of various commercially available SBRT treatment systems is also included.
