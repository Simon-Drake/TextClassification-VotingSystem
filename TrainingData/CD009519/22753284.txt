[Non-small-cell lung cancer - from symptoms to operation].
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the western world. Unfortunately, lung cancer is usually recognised late in its natural history. The most important risk factor is tobacco smoking. An abnormal chest radiograph is often the first line of imaging. Bronchoscopy is very important to get conclusive histological and cytological material. The PET/CT has a major role in the correct staging of non-small-cell lung cancer. Pulmonary resection candidates should undergo a structured pre-operative evaluation.
