Three-year findings of an early lung cancer detection feasibility study with low-dose spiral computed tomography in heavy smokers.
BACKGROUND: Low-dose spiral computed tomography (sCT) showed a four-fold increase in the detection rate in high-risk subjects and a higher percentage of stage I lung cancer in comparison with chest X-ray. However, there is a considerable discrepancy among studies in the percentage of lung nodules, overall lung cancer and stage I detection rate. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From April to December 2001, 520 asymptomatic volunteers aged >or=55 years with a history of cigarette smoking >or=20 pack-years and no previous cancer were enrolled to receive an annual sCT of the chest for five consecutive years. RESULTS: Seventy three per cent were male, median age was 59 years and 91% were current smokers. At baseline, nodules >or=5 mm were detected in 114 (22%) undergoing sCT; the size of lung nodules ranged from 5 to 9.9 mm in 81.5% of the cases. Five (1%) cases of lung cancer were detected. In two additional cases a pathological diagnosis of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia was made. Three new cases of lung cancer were detected in the second and third year of the study. One interval case was detected during the third year. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some promising data, convincing evidence from ongoing randomized trials is needed to support the routine use of sCT as a recommended tool for screening of lung cancer.
