Glucose utilization in vivo by human pulmonary neoplasms.
Neoplastic tissue in general shows a high rate of glucose consumption under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Using positron emission tomography (PET) we measured the rate of uptake of the glucose analogue 18fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) in 12 patients with carcinoma of the lung. The tumor types were six squamous cell, two large cell, two oat cell, one adenocarcinoma, and one undifferentiated carcinoma. In each patient a transaxial plane was selected that contained the bulk of the tumor tissue. Regional density and blood volume were measured. Following the intravenous injection of 18FDG, the rates of uptake in the tumor and normal lung tissue were assessed from sequential scans over 1 hour. In each patient the rate of uptake of 18FDG in the tumor tissue was significantly increased relative to normal lung tissue. For the group the rate of uptake by the tumor was 211.4 +/- 69.4 ml/100 g/hr (mean +/- SD) compared to 31.9 +/- 13.2 in the contralateral lung (P less than 0.05). The tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of 6.6 (range, 2.7 to 14.6) was higher than previously reported ratios for brain and liver tumors. In contrast to brain tumors there was little correlation between tumor type and rate of 18FDG uptake. Measurements of glucose metabolism taken in vivo in human pulmonary tumors may lead to advances in screening, staging, and therapy.
