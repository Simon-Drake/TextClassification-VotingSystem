Evaluation of primary pulmonary carcinoid tumors using FDG PET.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the spectrum of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) findings in patients who have primary pulmonary carcinoid tumors. CONCLUSION: On FDG PET imaging, pulmonary carcinoid tumors usually have lower FDG uptake than expected for malignant tumors. Biopsy or close radiologic follow-up is therefore recommended for solitary pulmonary nodules that are clinically suspected of being carcinoid tumors and that do not show increased metabolic activity on FDG PET images.
