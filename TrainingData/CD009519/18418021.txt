Extraneural spread of glioblastoma--report of two cases.
BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive tumor, accounts for the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. Despite a destructive local growth pattern, extraneural spread of these tumors is extremely rare. CASE 1: We describe the case of a 58-year-old man with glioblastoma, in whom an epidural mass was diagnosed 5 months after initial local therapy of the brain. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed multiple metastases in the lungs, in the retroperitoneum, and in the left trochanter minor region. A soft tissue swelling of the right thigh was histologically proven to be metastatic tissue from the primary glioblastoma. The patient died 11 months after initial diagnosis. CASE 2: A 47-year-old woman with recurrent glioblastoma had a long lasting complete response to chemotherapy. 2 years after initial diagnosis she presented with a pleural mass which was a metastasis of the formerly diagnosed glioblastoma. CONCLUSION: Although systemic metastases in glioblastoma are rare, different organs can be involved.
