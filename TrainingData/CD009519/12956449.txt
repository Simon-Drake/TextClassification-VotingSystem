Case report: PET scan detects prostate cancer in a patient with Hodgkins lymphoma.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is routinely used in the management of cancers such as lung, colorectal, esophageal, breast, lymphoma, and melanoma. In urologic oncology, the role of PET has been less well defined and is currently under investigation. We report the first case of PET scan detection of prostate cancer in a patient with Hodgkins lymphoma.
