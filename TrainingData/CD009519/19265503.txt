A patient with micropapillary thyroid carcinoma and macronodular lung metastasis: stable disease for eight years without treatment.
In this report, we described a very rare type of patient with micropapillary thyroid carcinoma with macronodular lung metastasis that had prolonged growth arrest for more than 8 years without any treatment. Unlike previous reports with stable metastasis, the patient presented here was older than prior cases and had a smaller size of the primary carcinoma.
