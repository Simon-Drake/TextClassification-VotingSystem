Characterization of radiologically indeterminate lung lesions: 99mTc-depreotide SPECT versus 18F-FDG PET.
AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 99m Tc-depreotide vs PET-18FDG scans in patients with suspicion of lung cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study in 29 patients (age: 38-80 years) diagnosed of inderteminate lung lesions. Diagnosis was established by histology based on samples of surgical resection, fine needle aspiration (FNA) or broncoalveolar lavage (BAL). Within a maximum of 10 days, without pre-established fixed order the following exams were performed: 1) Whole body and chest SPECT-CT with Tc-depreotide (DEP-SPECT) and 2) PET-CT study with F-FDG (PET-FDG). Every exam was evaluated by Nuclear Medicine especialist blinded to patient data. RESULT: Malignancy was confirmed in 20 patients. PET-FDG was positive in all cases. DEP-SPECT was positive in 17 and falselly negative in 3, one carcinoid tumor, one undifferentiated non-small cell adenocarcinoma, and a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. In the remaining 9 patients benignancy was confirmed; both studies were normal in 8 and falselly positive in one case of non-specific inflammatory lung process. In 9 out of the 20 cases with malignancy extrapulmonar uptake was seen, with a total number of 19 lesions. In two cases the extrapulmonar uptake were non ganglionar metastasis (bone and adrenal) and in 7 due to mediastinic ganglionar involvement. ROC analysis using peak SUV FDG (cut-off point of 3.5) uptake and target/background depreotide uptake (cut-off point of 1.3) provided, sensitivity and specificity values of 95% and 89% of 84% and 88% for PET and SPECT respectively. It does not exist statistically significant differences between both methods (Z-test SPSS). In summary, FDG-PET has a greater sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy for assessing malignancy of indeterminate lung lesions, and for detection of extrapulmonary involvement, DEP-SPECT represents a good diagnostic alternative for centers where PET is not available.
