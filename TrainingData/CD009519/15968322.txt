[Study of clinical value of dual-phase imaging using single photon emission computed tomography with coincidence detection for differentiating benign from malignant lesions].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical value of dual-phase imaging of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) using single photon emission computed tomography with coincidence detection (SPECT with coincidence) for differentiating benign and malignant lesions. METHODS: Thirty patients with unknown lesions from June 2003 to March 2004 in our hospital were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent dual-phase imaging of 18F-FDG SPECT with coincidence. The early images were obtained 60 min post injection. And the patients were divided into 2 groups, one receiving delayed scans at 210 min after 18F-FDG injection and the other at 270 min. Lesion status was determined by pathologic findings or by clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-eight lesions (30 malignant and 18 benign lesions verified by pathologic findings or clinical follow-up) of 30 patients were detected by dual-phase imaging, in which there were 29 true positive results, 15 true negative, 3 false positive and 1 false negative. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of dual-phase imaging were 96.7%, 83.3%, 91.6%, 90.6%, and 93.8%, respectively. Those of early imaging and CT were 93.3%, 72.2%, 85.4%, 84.8%, 86.7% and 76.9%, 57.1%, 70.0%, 76.9%, 57.1%, respectively. The T/NT of all malignant lesions (except 1 false negative case) in delayed imaging were significantly increased (t=-3.071, P<0.01). However, there were no statistical differences in the T/NT of benign lesions (t=0.398, P=0.695) between early and delayed imagings. CONCLUSION: Dual-phase imaging of FDG SPECT with coincidence provides benefit for differentiating benign and malignant lesions.
