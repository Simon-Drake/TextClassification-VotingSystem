F-18 FDG PET-CT imaging of intestinal metastasis from primary lung cancer.
Intestinal metastasis of lung cancer was diagnosed in a 67-year-old man with palpable masses in the axilla and lower abdomen. F-18 FDG PET/CT showed a large cavitary mass with an SUV of 14.1, which was similar to that of the lung mass, in the left lower quadrant of peritoneal cavity. Intestinal metastasis is rarely found, although symptoms related to the digestive tract are not uncommon in patients with lung cancer. Physicians should be aware of this possibility because a small intestinal metastasis often perforates, leading to life-threatening peritonitis.
