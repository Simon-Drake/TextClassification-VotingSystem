F-18 FDG PET/CT imaging of low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the bronchus.
Mucoepidermoid carcinomas in the bronchial tree are extremely rare tumors. Such tumors are classified into low-grade and high-grade on the basis of histological criteria. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18 FDG PET) is a useful technique for the evaluation of pulmonary lesions; however, to our knowledge, F-18 FDG PET findings in mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the bronchus have been described in only a few cases. Identifiable focal F-18 FDG uptake has been reported in high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, but it is unclear whether F-18 FDG accumulates in low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Here, we present the case of a 37-year-old woman, with pathologically proven low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, who underwent high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and F-18 FDG PET/CT before treatment.
