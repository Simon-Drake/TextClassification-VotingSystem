[Refined staging in Hilar bronchial neoplasms with ECG-gated multislice-CT---case report].
Equivocal initial CT-based staging in 2 patients with hilar bronchial neoplasms was reassessed with retrospective ECG-gated Multislice-CT and optimized examination parameters prior to definition of treatment. An initially suspected irresectable T4 tumor with mediastinal infiltration was downstaged to T2 in one case, while tumor infiltration into the left atrium could be confirmed in the other case. In doubtful conditions, ECG-gated multislice CT with optimized examination parameters may be helpful for refined staging in patients with hilar bronchial neoplasms, thus possibly influencing treatment strategies.
