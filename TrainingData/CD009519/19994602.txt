[A case of miliary tuberculosis difficult to distinguish from metastatic lung cancer].
We report a case of the coexistence of pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer maked a wrong diagnosis of lung cancer and metastatic lung carcinoma. The patient was a 80-years-old woman who had ascites and anorexia and decreased weight. Chest CT film showed a mass shadow in the right S, and infiltrative shadows on bilateral lung fields. FDG-PET revealed the tumor in the right lower lung field and many infiltrative shadows in all lung fields, and showed that FDG accumulated diffusely along the peritoneum. We made a diagnosis of lung cancer and metastatic lung carcinoma. However we obtained a diagnosis of coexisting of pulmonary tuberclosis and lung cancer autopsy. When the patient has a shadow suggestive of lung tumor shadow with many infiltrative shadows, we tend to make a diagnosis of lung cancer and metastatic lung carcinoma. We saw the importance of a postmortem examination in a new light.
