Benign intrapulmonary schwannoma: aspect on F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT.
A 75-year-old man, with no significant symptoms, was referred after the incidental finding of a left hilar pulmonary mass of 30 x 30 x 50 mm on a chest CT. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT demonstrated a heterogeneous, moderate radiotracer uptake in the mass (SUV 3.5 g/mL). Bronchoscopy revealed a discrete extrinsic compression of the superior bronchus without endobronchial lesion. Endobronchial fine-needle biopsies could not deliver a final diagnosis. The patient underwent upper lobectomy by thoracotomy. Histopathology revealed a benign intrapulmonary schwannoma. Although rare, intermediate FDG uptake in the settings of a pulmonary mass should include schwannoma in the differential diagnosis.
