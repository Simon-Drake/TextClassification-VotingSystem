[A case of secondary inflammatory breast cancer with multiple metastases in which operation was possible through letrozole monotherapy].
A 55-year-old woman visited our clinic for rapid swelling of her left breast. The left breast was palpated, and a mass of about 10 cm with thick skin, and multiple lymph nodes in the supraclavicle and axilla were found. PET-CT images showed an increased uptake in her left breast, lymph nodes, spine of TH5, sternum, left lobe of liver, and both lungs. The serum tumor markers were also found to be elevated. A core needle biopsy was performed, and the tumor was diagnosed as secondary inflammatory carcinoma (invasive ductal carcinoma). Immunohistochemical staining showed negative for HER2 protein, but strongly positive for ER and PgR. Letrozole monotherapy administered her starting June, 2008. After 3 months, the metastases showed a notable response, which was subsequently maintained for 19 months. The tumor markers decreased to the normal range after 6 months, and the multiple metastases were not found by PET-CT after 1 year. A radiofrequency ablation operation was conducted on the remaining 3 cm breast cancer. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with letrozole was shown to be useful for post-menopausal breast cancer patients with strong hormone receptor expression.
