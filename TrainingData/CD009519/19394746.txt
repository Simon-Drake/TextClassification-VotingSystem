[Dermatofibroma metastasizing to the lung: current treatment].
Dermatofibromas are very common skin tumors. Their typical presentation is as a slow-growing, firm, solitary papule. They have been described histopathologically as a reaction of the connective tissue of the skin or as a benign neoplasm. Cases of these tumors metastasizing to the lung were first reported in 1990. Since then 12 cases with similar characteristics have been reported worldwide. We present the case of a young woman with a recurrent dermatofibroma on the shoulder that metastasized to both lungs. We discuss the histologic characteristics of this tumor that could raise suspicion of unusually aggressive behavior.
