[Tumor diagnosis using 18F-FDG SPECT].
Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) single photon emission CT(SPECT) imaging was performed in four patients with malignant neoplasms. Acquisition of SPECT was started 40 minutes after intravenous administration of 370MBq of 18F-FDG using dual-headed gamma camera equipped with 511keV collimators. Whole body planar scintigraphy was also obtained after the SPECT study. Tumor uptake of 18F-FDG was detected in three of four patients on both SPECT and planar images, and a 2.5 x 1.5 cm lung tumor was clearly visualized on SPECT image. Excellent SPECT image of 18F-FDG using a conventional gamma camera system is promising for the wide use of this system in cancer diagnosis.
