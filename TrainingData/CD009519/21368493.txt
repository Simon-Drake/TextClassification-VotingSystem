[A case of lung cancer with skin metastases responding to erlotinib].
The patient was a 67-year-old female with left lung adenocarcinoma T2N2M1(brain).She received systemic chemothera- py(cisplatin/docetaxel)and stereotactic radiosurgery.She showed a partial response and PET-CT evidenced no new metastasis. So she underwent left pneumonectomy(LtUt S6S8, adenocarcinoma mixed type pT2pN0).One month later, a small nodule appeared on the dorsal surface of her left hand.Excisional biopsy showed adenocarcinoma metastasis of lung cancer. Soon afterward, multiple skin nodules appeared and were diagnosed multiple skin metastases.Erlotinib was administered. After two weeks, skin metastases were reduced significantly, and she was treated with erlotinib on an outpatient basis for 5 months.This is, to our knowledge, the first case in which skin metastases of lung cancer responded to erlotinib.Our experience suggests erlotinib administration at an early treatment has fewer side effects in therapy for metastatic lung cancer.
