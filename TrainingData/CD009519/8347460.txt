Use of positron emission tomography in oncology.
Positron emission tomography is an imaging technique that produces images reflective of tissue biochemistry rather than anatomy. Utilizing different isotopes, many biochemical processes can be studied repetitively and non-invasively in cancers in vivo. Malignant tissue is characterized by an accelerated rate of glycolysis. This biochemical characteristic of malignancy can be exploited by PET imaging with the radiopharmaceutical FDG. PET with FDG has been successful in imaging primary and metastatic cancer of the breast, colon, lung, head and neck, as well as sarcomas and lymphomas. PET FDG imaging has potential as a screening, diagnostic and staging tool in cancer. Recently, whole body PET techniques have been developed which permit imaging of the entire body during a single scanning session. PET also has tremendous potential as a cancer research tool to study serial estimates of tumor glycolysis, DNA turnover, oxygen metabolism, protein synthesis, and blood.
