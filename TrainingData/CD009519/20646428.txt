[Value of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in hilar and mediastinal lesions].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) in cases of undiagnosed intrapulmonary lesions. METHODS: A total of 89 patients with intrathoracic lesions underwent EBUS-TBNA, including 56 pulmonary lesions, 7 lymph node staging in lung cancer patients, 21 unknown hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathies and 5 mediastinal tumors. All samples were evaluated for cytological and pathological examinations. RESULTS: No complication of EBUS-TBNA was observed. Among 89 cases, 76 had positive results, 5 negative and 5 cases excluded as unsatisfied samples. In 56 patients with pulmonary lesions, EBUS-TBNA demonstrated 45 malignant tumors, 5 benign diseases, 3 suspicious cancers, 1 negative and 2 unsatisfied samples. In 7 lung cancer patients staged by EBUS-TBNA, 5 showed metastasis and 2 showed no metastasis. In 21 cases with mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy, EBUS-TBNA demonstrated 3 malignant tumors, 13 benign diseases, 2 negative and 3 unsatisfied samples. All 5 mediastinal lesions were malignant. Three suspicious cancers were confirmed, 1 by CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy and 2 by clinical follow-ups. In 2 lung cancer patients EBUS-TBNA showed negative, 1 surgical sample showed metastasis and another no metastasis by PET-CT. Three negative cases were diagnosed as benign by clinical follow-ups. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of EBUS-TBNA were 95%, 100%, 100% and 20% respectively. CONCLUSION: EBUS-TBNA is both effective and safe in making a diagnosis of intrathoracic lesions.
