[Positron emission tomography detection of residual disease in a case of lung cancer].
To date, computed tomography is considered the best procedure to detect either relapse or residual disease in non-small cell lung cancer. However, in recent years several studies have stressed the value of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) which takes advantage of the enhanced glucose uptake observed in neoplastic cells. We present the case of a patient with a locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer who received trimodal treatment with induction chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and postoperative irradiation and lately developed brain metastases which were treated with chemoradiotherapy plus radiosurgery. However a small residual lesion remained in the brain magnetic resonance. Such abnormality was evaluated by means of FDG PET which did not show any increase on FDG uptake. The present case prompt us to review the role of FDG PET as a procedure that enable to detect subclinical disease and its potential usefulness taking into account the improvement in management strategies that has been attained in non-small cell lung cancer.
