[Value of fluorine-18 fluorode oxyglucose-positron emission tomography in patients with small cell lung cancer].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in patients with small cell lung cancer. METHODS: From February 2000 to July 2003, 17 patients with small cell lung cancer were imaged with FDG-PET. FDG-PET scans were analyzed by visual method. The FDG-PET results were compared with the pathological results and results of follow-up survey. RESULTS: 15 primary tumors were all FDG avid. By visual method 63 areas metastatic lymph nodes in 15 cases were revealed and more distant metastases outside the hemithoraxes were confirmed by FDG-PET than by routine examinations. FDG-PET corrected the diagnosis 5 cases from local disease (LD) to extended disease (ED). CONCLUSION: FDG-PET has great value in staging and treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer.
