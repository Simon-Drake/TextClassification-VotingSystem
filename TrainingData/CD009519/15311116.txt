Asymmetric tongue muscle uptake of F-18 FDG: possible marker for cranial nerve XII paralysis.
A 58-year-old woman, with nonsmall cell carcinoma, had multiple metastasis on 2-F-18 FDG positron emission tomography imaging. The right hemitongue had increased activity as compared with the left. This was not the result of the presence of a metastasis to the tongue, as shown by a negative computed tomography scan of the region and failure to demonstrate a lesion over a period of weeks. Uptake was likely related to right hemiglossal muscle activity. This was made more apparent by decreased uptake on the opposite side of the tongue (up to the midline) as a result of left cranial nerve XII paralysis.
