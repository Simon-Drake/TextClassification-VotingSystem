[Radiofrequency ablation of malignant lung tumours. Judicious approach?].
BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique and well established in the treatment of malignant hepatic tumours. This method could also find application in patients with malignant lung tumours who, for functional reasons, have to be excluded from standard surgery. Until now, however, very little data have been available on the application of RFA in malignant pulmonary tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From November 2001 to January 2004, eleven malignant lesions of the lung were treated with RFA. The indication for RFA resulted from an inadequate pulmonary reserve and additional severe risk factors. RESULTS: Eleven lesions were treated in ten patients with RFA. The malignancies were primary non-small cell bronchial carcinomas (n=9) as well as metastases of non-small cell carcinomas (n=2). Early complications of RFA were pneumothorax, hemorrhagic intrapleural effusion, bronchopleural fistula and pericarditis. Two weeks after RFA, pneumonia appeared as a late complication. No patient's death was related to the RFA procedure. After a mean follow-up of 8.5 months five patients died. Five patients are still alive, two of whom exhibit no tumour recurrence. CONCLUSION: RFA in patients with lung tumours is possible from a technical viewpoint. It is possibly a therapeutic alternative for patients with localized tumours that are inoperable. However, in this series, the morbidity of the procedure -- taking the degree of invasiveness into account -- is high, and the oncological results are unsatisfactory, possibly due to a small cohort of patients.
