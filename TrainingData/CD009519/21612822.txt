Peptide-conjugated polymeric micellar nanoparticles for Dual SPECT and optical imaging of EphB4 receptors in prostate cancer xenografts.
EphB4, a member of the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in numerous tumors. In this study, we developed a new class of multimodal nanoplatform for dual single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and near-infrared fluorescence imaging of EphB4. EphB4-binding peptide TNYL-FSPNGPIARAW (TNYL-RAW) was conjugated to polyethylene glycol-coated, core-crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPM) dually labeled with near-infrared fluorescence fluorophores (Cy7) and a radioisotope (indium 111). In vitro, TNYL-RAW-CCPM selectively bound to EphB4-positive PC-3M prostate cancer cells, but not to EphB4-negative A549 lung cancer cells. In vivo, PC-3M tumors were clearly visualized by both SPECT and near-infrared fluorescence tomography after intravenous administration of (111)In-labeled TNYL-RAW-CCPM. In contrast, there was little signal in A549 tumors of mice injected with (111)In-labeled TNYL-RAW-CCPM or in PC-3M tumors of mice injected with (111)In-labeled CCPM. The high accumulation of (111)In-labeled TNYL-RAW-CCPM in PC-3M tumor could be significantly reduced after co-injection with an excess amount of TNYL-RAW peptide. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that fluorescence signal from the nanoparticles correlated with their radioactivity count, and co-localized with the EphB4 expressing region. (111)In-labeled TNYL-RAW-CCPM allowed visualization of cancer cells overexpressing EphB4 by both nuclear and optical techniques. The complementary information acquired with multiple imaging techniques should be advantageous in early detection of cancer.
