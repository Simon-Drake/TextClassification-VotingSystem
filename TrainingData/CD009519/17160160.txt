Unilateral pulmonary metastases from Ewing's sarcoma shown in a technetium-99m-methylene-diphosphonate bone scan.
A 32-year-old man with a history of painful swelling of the right ankle underwent bone scintigraphy, which showed increased uptake in the right ankle and also unexpected diffuse uptake throughout the right hemithorax. A single photon emission tomography scan performed after the intravenous injection of 740 MBq of technetium-99m methylene-diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-MDP) showed abnormal uptake throughout the right lung. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large mass in the right lower lobe. CT-guided biopsy of this mass led to a diagnosis of metastatic Ewing's sarcoma. Although lung uptake on bone scans has been noted in various occasions (such as: pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and various tumoral lesions), increased uptake of (99m)Tc-MDP in lung metastases of Ewing's sarcoma has not been reported according to our knowledge until now. We report such a case.
