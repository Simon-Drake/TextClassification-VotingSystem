[A case of pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation].
A 70-year-old woman with cough was diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma by bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy. She was diagnosed cT2N0M0, stage IB clinically, and the tumor was surgically resected. Postoperative pathology was confirmed to be pleomorphic carcinoma of pT2N2M0, stage III A. She received 6 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and docetaxel. Five months later, new pulmonary and bone metastases were detected. Gefitinib was started, and she has shown stable disease for 7 months. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation was observed in her tumor specimens.
