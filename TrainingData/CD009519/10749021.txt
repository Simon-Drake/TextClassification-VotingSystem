Complete pathological response to chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer demonstrated by gamma camera positron emission tomography.
We report the case history of a 61-year-old female smoker who presented with an inoperable T2N2M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the right upper lobe bronchus. This was staged by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) using a modified dual-headed gamma camera, and mediastinoscopy. She then underwent three cycles of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. After the chemotherapy, CT demonstrated a residual 10 mm mass in the right upper lobe and a considerable reduction in size of the mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Functional tumour imaging with PET showed no abnormality, suggesting that there was no remaining viable tumour. At right upper lobectomy a complete pathological response was confirmed. We discuss PET, the potential new applications of gamma camera technology, and the use of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.
