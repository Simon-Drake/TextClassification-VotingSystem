Limbic encephalitis and hyperactive foci on PET scan.
Two cases of patients with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, difficult to control seizures, and unilateral hippocampal hypermetabolism on positron emission tomography (PET) are described. Two women aged 33 and 61 presented with uncontrolled complex partial seizures, profound memory loss and cognitive decline. One was later diagnosed with breast cancer and the other with lung cancer. Video-EEG on the first patient recorded multifocal sharp waves and bilateral independent seizure onsets. The second patient had no epileptiform discharges and bitemporal ictal onset, even though the clinical seizures suggested a right temporal onset. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal in both patients. PET scans obtained in the interictal state showed right hippocampal hypermetabolism in both patients. In the second patient, the lung cancer was irradiated with resolution of seizures and improvement of memory function. A PET scan six months later was normal. Subsequent seizure recurrence and worsening of memory led to the discovery of widespread metastases. Limbic encephalitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intractable partial epilepsy, particularly if accompanied by severe memory loss and cognitive decline. Treatment of the underlying cancer may be lead to improved seizure control. Hippocampal hypermetabolism may be a common feature on PET, and may indicate subclinical seizure activity.
