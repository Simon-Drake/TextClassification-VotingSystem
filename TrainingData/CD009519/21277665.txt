Significance of the presence of lymphocytes in the cytological analysis of transbronchial needle aspiration.
AIM: To evaluate the clinical relevance of the presence of lymphocytes in transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) samples from pathological mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with suspected lung cancer. METHODS: Retrospective observational study evaluating the negative predictive value (NPV) of TBNA samples containing lymphocytes but not malignant cells. RESULTS: A total of 266 TBNA were performed in 252 patients with pathological lymph nodes. One hundred and fifteen TBNA samples had evidence of malignant cells (43%), and 94 (35%) samples were considered as inadequate (absence of adequate cytological material or exclusive presence of bronchial epithelial cells). Out of the 57 TBNA samples remaining (21%), 15 could not be confirmed; in 32, TBNA samples were confirmed with alternative diagnostic techniques and in 10, they were confirmed after clinical and radiological follow-up. The NPV of the 32 samples that were confirmed with alternative diagnostic techniques was 84% decreasing down to 76% when the 10 TBNA samples confirmed after clinical and radiological follow-up were included. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of lymphocytes in the TBNA sample does not exclude the neoplasic invasion of the specific lymph node analyzed.
