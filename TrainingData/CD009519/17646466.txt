Airway leiomyoma: imaging findings and histopathologic comparisons in 13 patients.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to review retrospectively the imaging findings on tracheobronchial leiomyoma and to compare them with the pathologic findings. CONCLUSION: Leiomyoma of the respiratory tract is located in the bronchi in two thirds of patients and in the trachea in one third. The tumor most commonly manifests on CT scans as a homogeneously enhancing airway tumor with intraluminal growth. In approximately 15% of patients, the tumor has an iceberg appearance.
