[Paraneoplasic pandysautonomia with anti-Hu antibodies: a presentation of pulmonary adenocarcinoma identified by PET scanning].
A 74-year-old man developed pandysautonomia with severe orthostatic hypotension. Search for a paraneoplastic etiology was confirmed with the positivity of anti-Hu antibodies. [18] Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) enabled recognition of a lung adenocarcinoma. We emphasize the usefulness of PET scans for early diagnosis of cancer.
