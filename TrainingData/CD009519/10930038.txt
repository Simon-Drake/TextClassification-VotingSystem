Mutations of ras protooncogenes and p53 tumor suppressor gene in cardiac hemangiosarcomas from B6C3F1 mice exposed to 1,3-butadiene for 2 years.
1,3-Butadiene is a multisite carcinogen in rodents. Incidences of cardiac hemangiosarcomas were significantly increased in male and female B6C3F1 mice that inhaled 1,3-butadiene (BD) for 2 years. Eleven BD-induced cardiac hemangiosarcomas were examined for genetic alterations in ras protooncogenes and in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Nine of 11 (82%) BD-induced hemangiosarcomas had K-ras mutations and 5 of 11 (46%) had H-ras mutations. All of the K-ras mutations were G-->C transversions (GGC-->CGC) at codon 13; this pattern is consistent with reported results in BD-induced lung neoplasms and lymphomas. Both K-ras codon 13 CGC mutations and H-ras codon 61 CGA mutations were detected in 5 of 9 (56%) hemangiosarcomas. The 11 hemangiosarcomas stained positive for p53 protein by immunohistochemistry and were analyzed for p53 mutations using cycle sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded sections. Mutations in exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were identified in 5 of 11 (46%) hemangiosarcomas, and all of these were from the 200- or 625-ppm exposure groups that also had K-ras codon 13 CGC mutations. Our data indicate that K-ras, H-ras, and p53 mutations in these hemangiosarcomas most likely occurred as a result of the genotoxic effects of BD and that these mutations may play a role in the pathogenesis of BD-induced cardiac hemangiosarcomas in the B6C3F1 mouse.
