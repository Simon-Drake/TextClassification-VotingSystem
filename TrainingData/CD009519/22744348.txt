Screening for lung cancer using low-dose spiral CT: 10 years later, state of the art.
Ten years after the first papers on this subject, this editorial represents a brief review on lung cancer screening with low-dose spiral CT. The aim is to present the main theoretical and practical problems related to lung cancer screening, the historical background and results of observational studies and the main ongoing randomised controlled trials. In particular, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), which was interrupted early, is discussed. The opinion of the authors is that too many questions are still awaiting an answer.
