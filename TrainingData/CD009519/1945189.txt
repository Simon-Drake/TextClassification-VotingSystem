201Tl SPECT in the detection of mediastinal lymph node metastases from lung cancer.
201Tl SPECT was performed to detect mediastinal involvement in 80 patients with lung cancer who underwent surgery within a week after the SPECT study. Out of 29 patients with mediastinal involvement 16 (55%) were positive on the 201Tl early scan at 15 min postinjection and 22 (76%) were positive on the delayed scan at 3 h. These metastatic lymph nodes tended to be visualized much better on the delayed scan. In all patients with true positive results on the delayed scan, the mediastinal lymph nodes were plural, with a lesion of more than 14 mm in size. Seven false negative cases were found to have metastatic lesions less than 12 mm in size. Both the early and delayed scans showed false positive accumulation in six of 51 patients without mediastinal involvement (specificity 88%). Thus the overall accuracy for the delayed scan was 84%. The 201Tl delayed SPECT is thought to be a good noninvasive method for assessing mediastinal lymph node metastases from lung cancer.
