Respiratory-gated 18F-FDG PET imaging in lung cancer: effects on sensitivity and specificity.
BACKGROUND: Respiratory motion is known to deteriorate positron emission tomography (PET) images and may lead to potential diagnostic errors when a standardized uptake value (SUV) cut-off threshold is used to discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare ungated and respiratory-gated 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (CT) methods for the characterization of pulmonary nodules. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The list-mode acquisition during respiratory-gated PET was combined with a short breath-hold CT scan to form the CT-based images. We studied 48 lesions in 43 patients. PET images were analyzed in terms of the maximum SUV (SUV(max)) and the lesion location. RESULTS: Using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the optimal SUV cut-off thresholds for the ungated and CT-based methods were calculated to be 2.0 and 2.2, respectively. The corresponding sensitivity values were 83% and 92%, respectively, with a specificity of 67% for both methods. The two methods gave equivalent performance levels for the upper and middle lobes (sensitivity 93%, specificity 62%). They differed for the lower lobes, where the CT-based method outperformed the ungated method (sensitivity values of 90% and 70%, respectively, and a specificity of 73% with both methods) - especially for lesions smaller than 15 mm. CONCLUSION: The CT-based method increased sensitivity and did not diminish specificity, compared with the ungated method. It was more efficient than the ungated method for imaging the lower lobes and smallest lesions, which are most affected by respiratory motion.
