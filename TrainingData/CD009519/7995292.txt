Assessment of tumour necrosis and detection of mediastinal lymph node metastasis in bronchial carcinoma with technetium-99m sestamibi imaging: comparison with CT scan.
Thirty-eight patients with four major types of bronchial carcinoma were studied to evaluate technetium-99m sestamibi imaging in the assessment of tumour necrosis and the detection of hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis. Quantitative analysis was also performed to ascertain whether tumour uptake values correlate with histological types of bronchial carcinoma. Of the patients, 34 showed tumour uptake on planar imaging (n = 38) and 27 on single-photon emission tomography (SPET) (n = 29), the overall sensitivity in the localisation of primary tumour being 89% with planar imaging and 93% with SPET. Four types of tumour uptake pattern were identified: (1) focal uptake, (2) focal uptake with a central hypoactive focus. (3) ring-like uptake and (4) no uptake (negative uptake). Tumour necrosis was diagnosed in 12 patients based upon histopathology (n = 2) and density measurements and type of contrast enhancement on computed tomography (CT) scan (n = 12). Defective tumour uptake was seen in 11 of these patients on planar images (focal uptake with a central hypoactive focus, n = 7; ring-like uptake, n = 2; and no tumour uptake, n = 2) and in 12 patients on SPET (focal uptake with a central hypoactive focus, n = 7, ring-like uptake, n = 3, and no uptake, n = 2). Hilar and mediastinal lymph node involvement was detected in ten patients on CT scan, nine on planar images and 11 on SPET. A total of 26 metastatic lymph nodes were detected on CT scan: 24 of these were seen on planar, and all 26 on SPET images.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
