[SPECT images after intravenous injection of 99mTc-DTPA in lung tumors--comparison with delayed 123I-IMP lung scintigraphy].
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of SPECT imaging of the thorax with 99mTc-DTPA, which accumulates at sites of increased capillary permeability and expanded extracellular space, by comparing it with delayed 123I-IMP lung scintigraphy. We have previously reported that increased uptake on delayed 123I-IMP lung scintigraphy was associated with atelectasis and inflammation. Thirteen patients with lung cancer (4 with atelectasis and 3 with pleurisy), one patient with malignant lymphoma complicated by pneumonia and pleurisy, and one patient with pneumonia were studied. 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy was performed twice, 20-160 minutes and 2-4 hours after the intravenous administration of 370 MBq of 99mTc-DTPA. 123I-IMP scintigraphy was performed 24 hours after the intravenous injection of 111 MBq of 123I-IMP. SPECT images were obtained with both types of scintigraphy. 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy was compared with 123I-IMP scintigraphy for its ability to detect atelectasis and pneumonia. All patients showed increased accumulation corresponding to the lesions on both 123I-IMP and 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy. 123I-IMP scintigraphy showed a defect corresponding to the tumor with increased accumulation around the tumor, whereas 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy showed accumulation corresponding to the tumor. Ten of 11 tumors showed accumulation of an intensity equal to that of the soft tissue of the chest wall on 20-60 min 99mTc-DTPA images. The 2-4 hr images showed that 99mTc-DTPA leaked from the periphery of the tumor toward its center. All the patients with pleurisy showed increased accumulation in effusion on 2-4 hr 99mTc-DTPA scintigraphy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
