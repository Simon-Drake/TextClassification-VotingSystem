Intracardiac extension of lung cancer demonstrated on PET scanning.
Intracardiac tumors are unusual and can originate within the heart or spread from other sites. This is a report of a patient who presented with a TIA, and during the subsequent stroke workup, a right hilar nonsmall cell lung carcinoma was discovered. The tumor had extended into the left atrium through a pulmonary vein. The hilar tumor as well as intracardiac extension were demonstrated by PET scanning using FDG.
