Extranodal lymphoma in the thorax: cross-sectional imaging findings.
The purpose of this review is to discuss and illustrate the spectrum of appearances of extranodal lymphoma in the thorax, including the lungs, pleura, heart, thymus, chest wall, thoracic spine, and breast, using current cross-sectional imaging techniques, such as multidetector computed tomography, positron-emission tomography/computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and sonography. Extranodal lymphoma can affect any organ or tissue in the thorax, and can be mistaken for other inflammatory or neoplastic conditions. This review should alert the radiologist to consider extranodal lymphoma in the appropriate clinical setting to ensure timely diagnosis, correct staging, and accurate post-treatment evaluation to optimize treatment regimens.
