[Value of carbon-11 choline positron emission tomography in patients with pulmonary abnormalities].
OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of carbon-11 choline (CH) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with pulmonary nodules. METHODS: From September 2002 to December 2004, 39 patients with pulmonary nodules were imaged with CH-PET. CH-PET data was analyzed by visual method and semiquantitative method. When pulmonary nodules with abnormal CH uptake appeared in PET scans confirmed by visual method, their maximum and mean standard uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean) were measured using semiquantitative method. Diagnoses were confirmed by surgery or biopsy and follow-up survey. RESULTS: Twenty-four cancerous and 3 inflammatory nodules and 1 bronchogenic cyst were detected by CH-PET and were diagnosed malignant with visual method. Three bronchial alveolar carcinoma, 2 metastatic tumor from kidney and colon, 3 fibrous nodules, 1 cryptococcosis, 1 hamartoma and 1 sclerosing hemangioma showed nothing abnormal in PET scans. For identification of pulmonary nodules with CH-PET, the sensitivity was 89% (24/29), the specificity was 60% (6/10), and the accuracy was 77% (30/39). There were differences in SUV between 8 squamous cell carcinomas and 9 adenocarcinomas (Z = -2.937, -2.887, P < 0.01). In diagnosing 70 resected enlarged lymph nodes beyond 1 cm in 17 lung cancer patients, CH-PET had the sensitivity of 86% (25/29), the specificity of 90% (37/41), and the accuracy of 89% (62/70). CH-PET confirmed 7 distant metastases in 25 lung cancer patients. In 5 cases suspected brain metastases CH-PET identified 2 cases positive correctly. CONCLUSIONS: CH-PET can confirm malignant pulmonary nodules, but still there were false positive and false negative cases. CH-PET can evaluate N stage effectively in patients with lung cancer. CH-PET can depict brain metastases accurately.
