[Efficacy of fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging in response evaluation of patients with small cell lung cancer (pilot study)].
The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of PET/CT in response evaluation of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Among the 25 patients with primary small cell lung cancer who had been treated from August 2004 through to May 2008, we compared the response evaluation between conventional CT and fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), [CMR (Complete Metabolic Response), PMR (Partial Metabolic Response), SMD (Stable Metabolic Disease), PMD (Progressive Metabolic Disease)] before and after the treatment. Response assessment was discordant in 2 out of 25 cases (8%) after the first cycle of chemotherapy and in 3 out of 19 cases (16%) after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy. Two discordant cases after the first cycle of chemotherapy were PR and SD respectively by CT but both were found to be PMD by PET. Two out of three discordant cases after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy were PR by CT but both found to be CMR by PET. These results suggest that FDG-PET is useful for response assessment of early diagnosis of recurrence and prognostic outlook in small cell lung cancer, however further cases need to be collected.
