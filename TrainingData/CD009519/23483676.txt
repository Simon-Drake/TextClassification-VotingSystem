Imaging characteristics of stage I non-small cell lung cancer on CT and FDG-PET: relationship with epidermal growth factor receptor protein expression status and survival.
OBJECTIVE: To identify CT and FDG-PET features associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein overexpression, and to evaluate whether imaging features and EGFR-overexpression can help predict clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 214 patients (M : F = 129 : 85; mean age, 63.2) who underwent curative resection of stage I non-small cell lung cancer, EGFR protein expression status was determined through immunohistochemical analysis. Imaging characteristics on CT and FDG-PET was assessed in relation to EGFR-overexpression. Imaging features and EGFR-overexpression were also evaluated for clinical outcome by using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: EGFR-overexpression was found in 51 patients (23.8%). It was significantly more frequent in tumors with an SUV(max) > 5.0 (p < 0.0001), diameter > 2.43 cm (p < 0.0001), and with ground glass opacity </= 50% (p = 0.0073). SUV(max) > 5.0 (OR, 3.113; 95% CI, 1.375-7.049; p = 0.006) and diameter > 2.43 cm (OR, 2.799; 95% CI, 1.285-6.095; p = 0.010) were independent predictors of EGFR overexpression. Multivariate analysis showed that SUV(max) > 4.0 (hazard ratio, 10.660; 95% CI, 1.370-82.966; p = 0.024), and the presence of cavitation within a tumor (hazard ratio, 3.122; 95% CI, 1.143-8.532; p = 0.026) were factors associated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: EGFR-overexpression is associated with high SUV(max), large tumor diameter, and small GGO proportion. CT and FDG-PET findings, which are closely related to EGFR overexpression, can be valuable in the prediction of clinical outcome.
