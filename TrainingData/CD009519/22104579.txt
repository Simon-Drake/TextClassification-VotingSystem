Two cases of temporal bone metastases as presenting sign of lung cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical and radiological features of temporal bone metastases and their association with primary lung cancer. CASE REPORTS: Both patients complained of headache, cochlear signs or cranial nerve palsy. Computed tomography of the petrous temporal bones and magnetic resonance imaging showed an osteolytic lesion of the temporal bone. The preoperative work-up was completed by chest, abdomen and pelvis computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Bronchoscopic biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of lung cancer. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The discovery of an osteolytic lesion of the temporal bone requires an aetiological work-up, including the search for a lung tumour based on the hypothesis of temporal bone metastasis. Positron emission tomography should now be performed in the context of such lesions. Management consists of palliative chemotherapy and analgesic radiotherapy.
