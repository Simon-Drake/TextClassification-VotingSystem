Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.
This review focuses on aspects of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) in which it differs importantly from other forms of non-small-cell lung cancer. BAC is a form of adenocarcinoma with unique clinical, radiological, and epidemiological features. With the notable exception of a lower likelihood of a positive positron-emission tomographic (PET) scan in BAC, staging, diagnosis, and treatment are largely the same as for other histological subtypes of lung cancer. However, additional treatment options exist that are equivalent, if not more effective, for many patients with BAC. The diagnosis of BAC should be reserved for those tumors meeting the 1999/2004 criteria set forth by the World Health Organization. Revised nomenclature proposed by an expert consensus panel may change how this disease is viewed. Additional clinical trials are needed on patients with BAC, employing strict definitions and enrollment criteria to allow the results to be applied to appropriate patient populations.
