Intravenous leiomyomatosis: diagnosis and follow-up with multislice computed tomography.
Intravenous leiomyomatosis is a rare disease, which appears histologically benign but is clinically aggressive. It is characterized by the intraluminal growth of leiomyomas in the intrauterine and systemic veins. Intravenous leiomyomatosis was reported to have originated in the uterus and extended into the right ventricle via the inferior vena cava (IVC). In these circumstances, it is fatal. Multislice compute tomography (MSCT) allows an early and accurate preoperative diagnosis, resulting in a higher rate of surgical resection and improved survival. The authors present 3 cases of intravenous leiomyomatosis with a history of uterine leiomyoma and hysterectomy. The lesions were found to have extended through the IVC into the right cardiac cavities and were confirmed to be intravenous leiomyomatosis by surgery.
