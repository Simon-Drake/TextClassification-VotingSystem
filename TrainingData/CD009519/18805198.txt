Intrapulmonary localized fibrous tumor of the lung: a very unusual presentation.
Most localized fibrous tumors arise from the visceral pleura on a stalk and project into the pleural cavity in a pedunculated manner. The origin of the tumors is now believed not to be mesothelial but rather submesothelial, based on studies using conventional histology, immunohistochemistry, and ultrastructural analysis. While inward tumor growth into the lung parenchyma with attachment to the pleura is uncommon, the tumor with an entirely pulmonary location is extremely rare. We present here a rare case of entirely intrapulmonary localized fibrous tumor (ie, localized fibrous tumor of the lung), and we review the pertinent literature.
