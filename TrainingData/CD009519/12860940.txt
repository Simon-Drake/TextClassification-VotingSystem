Positron emission tomography in non-small-cell lung cancer: prediction of response to chemotherapy by quantitative assessment of glucose use.
PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the use of positron emission tomography with the glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) to predict response to chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC scheduled to undergo platinum-based chemotherapy were eligible for this study. Patients were studied by FDG-PET before and after the first cycle of therapy. Based on previous studies, a reduction of tumor FDG uptake by more than 20% as assessed by standardized uptake values (SUV) was used as a criterion for a metabolic response. Furthermore, changes in tumor SUVs were compared with changes in FDG net-influx constants (Ki) and tumor/muscle ratios (t/m). RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were included in the study. There was a close correlation between metabolic response and best response to therapy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (P <.0001; sensitivity and specificity for prediction of best response, 95% and 74%, respectively). Median time to progression and overall survival were significantly longer for metabolic responders than for metabolic nonresponders (163 v 54 days and 252 days v 151 days, respectively). Similar results were obtained when Ki was used to assess tumor glucose use, whereas changes in t/m showed considerable overlap between responding and nonresponding tumors. CONCLUSION: In NSCLC, reduction of metabolic activity after one cycle of chemotherapy is closely correlated with final outcome of therapy. Using metabolic response as an end point may shorten the duration of phase II studies evaluating new cytotoxic drugs and may decrease the morbidity and costs of therapy in nonresponding patients.
