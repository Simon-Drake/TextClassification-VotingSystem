[Role of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography for the initial detection, staging, search for recurrences and restaging of gynaecological and breast cancers].
Positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a new metabolic imaging modality that is becoming accessible in France. Many centers have been or will be equipped soon. The indications of PET-FDG have been established in various settings in some oncology pathologies such as lymphoma or lung cancer, but not in gynaecological and breast cancers. Therefore, we aimed to precise the interest of PET-FDG to detect, stage and restage the cancers of breast, ovary, cervix and uterus by reviewing the recent publications.
