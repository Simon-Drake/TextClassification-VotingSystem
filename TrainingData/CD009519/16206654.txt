An unusual case of three synchronous tumors in a young woman.
The occurrence in the same young patient of three synchronous tumors deriving from different embryogenic tissues and without a clear correlation with a common etiopathogenic factor is very unusual. We report a case of a Caucasian woman submitted to wide resection of a large retroperitoneal liposarcoma and right radical nephrectomy for suspected tumor infiltration. Histological examination of the right ureter and renal pelvis showed the presence of a multifocal urothelial carcinoma that was clinically asymptomatic. Two months later, during follow-up, chest X-ray and computed tomography documented a coin lesion of the upper left lung, confirmed by positron emission tomography. This nodule was surgically removed and examined histologically, resulting in a diagnosis of sclerosing hemangioma. The patient is alive without evidence of recurrent disease.
