[How I investigate ... a broncho-pulmonary cancer by metabolic imaging (PET-18-FDG)].
Continuing advances in PET imaging have resulted in an improved ability to evaluate thoracic malignancies. Published reports demonstrate that PET provides accurate noninvasive detection of malignancy that is useful in the characterization of a pulmonary solitary nodule and in the mediastinal or extrathoracic staging of known lung cancer. Preliminary studies suggest that PET may also be able to assess the therapeutic response after surgery or radiation therapy.
