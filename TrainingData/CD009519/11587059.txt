Positron emission tomography: brain tumors and lung cancer.
F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a uniquely powerful diagnostic tool that noninvasively provides information that is critical to appropriate clinical management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Not only does the functional information provided by PET complement and clarify the anatomic information supplied by CT and MR imaging, but the superior sensitivity and negative predictive value of PET allow for improved accuracy in diagnosis, prognosis, staging, and monitoring the effects of treatment. With better information at their disposal, clinicians and patients are able to make better-informed decisions, contributing to more appropriate and more cost-effective medical care. Truly, FDG-PET has earned its place as the new standard of care in imaging non-small cell lung cancer.
