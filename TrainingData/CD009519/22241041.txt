18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography as a noninvasive method for the diagnosis of primary pulmonary artery sarcoma.
Pulmonary artery sarcomas are rare, difficult-to-diagnose tumors that frequently mimic chronic pulmonary thromboembolism. We report the cases of two female patients with clinical signs of dyspnea and lung masses associated with pulmonary artery filling defects on chest CT angiography. We performed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, which revealed increased radiotracer uptake in those lesions. Pulmonary artery sarcoma was subsequently confirmed by anatomopathological examination. We emphasize the importance of this type of tomography as a noninvasive method for the diagnosis of these tumors.
