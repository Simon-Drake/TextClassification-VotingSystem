[Early lung cancer detection in an occupational asbestos exposed population: clinical impact of low-dose computed tomography screening].
Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer mortality in developed countries. Early detection and surgical resection is essential for the treatment of lung cancer. The introduction of low-dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT) is considered one of the most promising clinical research developments in early diagnosis of lung cancer. Our study is aimed at the evaluation of spiral CT in a cohort of subjects with a past occupational exposure to asbestos at high risk of developing lung cancer. 149 subjects were enrolled between 2007 and 2009 (the criteria for enrollment were date of birth between 1930-1961, no previous cancer and general good health, latency from the beginning of exposure > 10 years, exposure duration > 1 year, possibility to undergo to surgery). A helical low-dose CT (LDCT) of the chest was performed yearly and an evaluation protocol derived from IEO with a morphological analysis of nodules have been adopted. 13 nodules were diagnosed in the first CT, 7 in the second and 3 in the third but no invasive procedures have been taken and no lung cancer have been detected. Our early follow-up data aren't able yet to evaluate the effect of screening with LDCT on mortality but have do not confirm some of the literature initial results such as the Increase in cases of overdiagnosis (false positive) due to the high prevalence of benign lesions.
