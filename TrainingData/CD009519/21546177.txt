Prognostic value of preoperative FDG-PET in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma.
BACKGROUND: Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been found to have prognostic value. We previously reported the correlation between SUVmax and pathological invasive area, and determined an SUVmax cut-off value of 2.15 for predicting the recurrence potential of an invasive area of diameter 5mm. Here, we evaluate the validity of FDG-PET for prediction of recurrence in pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: From February 2006 to May 2008, 100 patients with pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma underwent complete resection at our hospital. Tumors were classified as air-type or solid-type based on thin-section computed tomography (TS-CT) findings and the influence of TS-CT classification, SUVmax, and clinicopathologic features were evaluated in terms of the incidence of recurrence. RESULTS: Unlike air-type adenocarcinomas, recurrent disease was detected in 8 of 62 solid-type adenocarcinomas. SUVmax and diameter of invasive area were significantly correlated with recurrence and a shorter time to recurrence. All 8 recurrent cases had pathological invasive area >5mm. All except one case of recurrence were solid-type adenocarcinomas with SUVmax>/=2.15. Three-year disease-free survival rates were 100% in air-type adenocarcinomas, 97.1% in solid-type adenocarcinomas with SUVmax<2.15, and 74.1% in solid-type adenocarcinoma with SUVmax>/=2.15. CONCLUSION: Combined evaluation of TS-CT classification and SUVmax had significant value in predicting recurrence in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma, reflecting the aggressiveness of primary lung adenocarcinoma. Prediction of tumor aggressiveness could contribute to decision-making regarding the choice of surgical procedure and treatment after surgery.
