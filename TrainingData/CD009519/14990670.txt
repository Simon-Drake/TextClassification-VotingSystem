99mTc-Depreotide chest SPECT demonstrates pulmonary metastases from renal cell carcinoma.
99mTc-Depreotide has been used on single pulmonary nodules to identify somatostatin receptor-positive lung cancer. We report that pulmonary metastases of a 78-y-old man with postradical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma were detected by (99m)Tc-depreotide chest SPECT. Thus, (99m)Tc-depreotide chest SPECT can be used to diagnose secondary lung cancer, such as pulmonary metastases from renal cell carcinoma with somatostatin receptor-positive tumor, other than primary lung cancer. Depending on whether the (99m)Tc-depreotide was positive for pulmonary metastases, the patient underwent an appropriate therapy without further invasive procedures.
