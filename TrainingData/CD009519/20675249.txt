Multiple FDG-avid sclerosing hemangiomas mimicking pulmonary metastases in a case of soft tissue sarcoma.
Non-neoplastic lesions have been known to mimic malignancies and metastases on positron emission tomography/computed tomography. We report the rare occurrence of multiple fluorodeoxyglucose-concentrating sclerosing hemangiomas in a patient with soft tissue sarcoma mimicking lung metastases.
