Dual isotope SPECT in malignant Jacod's syndrome.
A case is presented of metastatic tumor causing Jacod's syndrome: total ophthalmoplegia, blindness, and trigeminal neuralgia. Abnormal soft tissue invading the orbital apex, anterior clinoid process, and cavernous sinus was difficult to assess by CT and MRI, but dual-isotope SPECT including Tc-99m HMDP bone imaging and Tl-201 tumor imaging strongly suggested that the cause of this rare syndrome was a small metastatic tumor. Although the therapeutic effect was also difficult to assess by anatomic imaging alone, dual-isotope SPECT after radiation therapy showed a decline of tumor viability.
