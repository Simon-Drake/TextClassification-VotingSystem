Resection for thoracic metastases from sarcoma.
Sarcoma metastasizes to the lungs in 20% to 40% of patients and in most cases does not involve any other organ. Systemic chemotherapy is of unproven benefit for stage IV sarcoma. Retrospective studies have shown 5-year survival rates of 21% to 38% with wedge resection of metastatic pulmonary nodules, and up to 30% to 40% of patients survive an additional 5 years with repeated metastasectomy. In this article, we provide an extensive review of patient selection criteria and surgical approaches, as well as of controversies regarding resection for metastatic sarcoma.
