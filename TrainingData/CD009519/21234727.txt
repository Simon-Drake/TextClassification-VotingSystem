Differential uptake of 18F-FDG in patients with synchronous lung cancers.
(18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) has developed into the standard of care for investigating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the optimal treatment. However, although the majority of patients with NSCLC do have intense uptake of tracer, false negatives do occur and should be considered. We report cases of patients that have synchronous NSCLCs. In both cases, there was intense uptake of FDG in one tumour type, with very low grade uptake in the separate tumour. Histology confirmed separate lung malignancies, demonstrating that differential FDG uptake may not always be inflammatory and should be considered to have a separate malignant aetiology.
