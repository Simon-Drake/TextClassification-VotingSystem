Intrapulmonary neurofibroma independent of neurofibromatosis type 1.
Intrapulmonary neurofibromas without neurofibromatosis type 1 are rare-so rare that only 11 cases have been reported previously. This case report describes a 37-year-old woman who was otherwise healthy. Chest radiography and computed tomography showed a solitary nodule, 20 mm diameter, in the left lung. The tumor was removed and examined. It was not encapsulated but was covered with an intact bronchial mucosa and lacked a clear partition into two areas of Antoni A (a palisading cellular component) and Antoni B (a loose myxoid component). Tumor cells were strongly positive for neuron-specific enolase and S-100 protein. These data characterized the tumor as a rare benign neurofibroma. The patient shows no sign of recurrence after 12 months of follow-up. We reviewed and characterized surgically resected cases of intrapulmonary neurofibroma without neurofibromatosis type 1 especially in comparison with cases of endotracheobronchial neurofibroma.
