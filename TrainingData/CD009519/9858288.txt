Diagnosis of spine metastases by FDG imaging using a gamma camera in the coincidence mode.
PURPOSE: To illustrate the detection of metastatic lung cancer using a conventional dual detector gamma camera modified to operate in the coincidence mode to image the static distribution of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). METHODS: A patient with known lung cancer underwent FDG imaging to evaluate the extent of metastatic disease. Twenty-three-minute emission image acquisition at one bed position using a dual detector coincidence gamma camera was performed to evaluate the entire chest and upper abdomen. RESULTS: In addition to detecting the malignant lung nodule, mediastinal lymph node metastases and a rib metastasis, symptomatic metastases to lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebral bodies, which were not identified on radiographs, CT, or bone scan, were shown clearly by FDG coincidence gamma camera imaging. CONCLUSION: FDG tumor imaging in the body is feasible using a dual detector gamma camera operating in coincidence mode and may find an important role in a certain subset of FDG tumor imaging.
