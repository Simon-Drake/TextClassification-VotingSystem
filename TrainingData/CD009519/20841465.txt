Ameloblastic carcinoma of the mandible with metastasis to the skull and lung: advanced imaging appearance including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography computed tomography.
Ameloblastic carcinoma is a very rare malignant odontogenic tumour with characteristic histopathological and clinical features, which requires aggressive surgical treatment and surveillance and, therefore, differs from ameloblastoma. Metastasis typically occurs in the lung. Only one patient with metastasis to the skull has previously been described and no prior case reports have presented MRI and positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) imaging findings. We describe a case of ameloblastic carcinoma with metastasis to the skull and lung with emphasis on imaging features including MRI and PET-CT.
