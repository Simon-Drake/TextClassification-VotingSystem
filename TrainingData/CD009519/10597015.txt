FDG/PET and spiral CT image fusion for medistinal lymph node assessment of non-small cell lung cancer patients.
BACKGROUND: To assess the potential usefulness of 18F-FDG/PET and spiral-CT images concurrent assessment and coregistration in staging mediastinal lymph node involvement in patients with non small cell lung cancer. METHODS: 28 patients waiting to undergo surgical treatment underwent spiral-CT and PET examinations on the same day. The results of the two studies were interpreted separately, together (CT&PET) and following their fusion in a single image (CT+PET). Results of spiral-CT, PET, CT&PET and CT+PET were assessed with respect to the histological diagnosis. RESULTS: A correct assessment of mediastinal lymph nodes was achieved by spiral-CT in 21 of the 28 patients, in 22 of the 28 patients by PET, in 24 patients by CT&PET and in 25 patients by CT+PET. CONCLUSIONS: CT+PET is more accurate than spiral-CT and PET alone in staging mediastinal lymph node involvement in lung cancer patients, with possible implications for their prognosis and therapy.
