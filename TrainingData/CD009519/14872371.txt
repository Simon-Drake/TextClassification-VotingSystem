[Diagnostic imaging of vascular leiomyosarcomas].
Primary vascular leiomyosarcomas are very rare tumors, with the venous variety most often arising from the inferior caval vein and the arterial variety from the pulmonary artery. The tumors show either an exclusive intra- or extravascular pattern or a mixed growth pattern. The clinical symptoms depend on tumor location, with intraluminal tumors of the inferior caval vein causing edema or a Budd-Chiari syndrome. Leiomyosarcomas of the pulmonary artery can mimic chronic central or recurrent peripheral pulmonary embolism. Contrast enhanced spiral CT with multiplanar reconstruction is the diagnostic method of choice when a vascular leiomyosarcoma is suspected. MRI with MR-angiography can be added. If a tumor of undetermined origin shows a broad contact with a vessel and/or an intraluminal component, possible primary vascular leiomyosarcoma should be included in the differential diagnosis.
