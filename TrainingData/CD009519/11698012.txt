Benign myoepithelioma of the lung: a case report and review of the literature.
This report describes a benign myoepithelioma of the lung that occurred in a 60-year-old woman. The patient had experienced hoarseness for 6 weeks, and a computed tomographic scan showed a nodule of approximately 2 cm in diameter at the peripheral portion of her right upper lung. Positron emission tomography showed no uptake of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose in the nodule. Wedge biopsy of the lesion showed benign spindle cells arranged in a whorled pattern. The cells were positive for both cytokeratin and smooth muscle actin, which corresponded to the presence of tonofilaments and myofilaments that were identified ultrastructurally. The features of the present case of benign myoepithelioma that differ from features of previously reported benign and malignant cases of myoepithelioma in the lung are discussed in the report.
