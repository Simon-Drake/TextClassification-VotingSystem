PET imaging of Sertoli cell tumor in androgen insensitivity syndrome.
The author presents a case of Sertoli cell tumor demonstrated incidentally by F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography during imaging workup for suspected right-lung malignant neoplasm. This rare sex cord stromal tumor arose from the right gonad of a patient with a history of androgen insufficiency syndrome, also known as testicular feminization syndrome. The relationship of this phenotypic sexual disorder with Sertoli cell tumor is briefly reviewed and discussed.
