[Correlation between SUV of (18)F-FDG PET-CT and the expression of GLUT1, MVD and Ki67 in non-small cell lung cancer].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between 18F-FDG standard uptake value (SUV) and expression of GLUT1, MVD and Ki67 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Thirty-three patients with non-small cell lung cancer received preoperative 18F-FDG PET-CT examination and underwent surgery. The expression of GLUT1, MVD and Ki67 were detected by immunohistochemstry. The correlation between the SUV of 18F-FDG PET-CT and the immunohistochemical results of the three above mentioned parameters was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 33 NSCLC patients, 21 were in stage I, 4 in stage II and 8 in stage IIIa. Positive expression of GLUT1 was found in 22 cases (66.7%, 12 adenocarcinomas and 10 squamous cell carcinomas), and negative expression in 11 cases (10 adenocarcinomas and 1 squamous cell carcinoma). Twenty-four patients (72.7%) showed positive expression of Ki67 (13 adenocarcinomas and 11 squamous cell carcinomas), and other 9 (adenocarcinomas) had negative expression. The positive expression rate of CD34 in this series was 100.0% with a mean MVD of 12.6 +/- 2.9. CONCLUSION: SUV of 18F-FDG PET-CT is linearly correlated with the expression of GLUT1, but not with the expression of Ki67 or MVD. The expression of GLUT1, Ki67 and CD34 is not correlated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis.
