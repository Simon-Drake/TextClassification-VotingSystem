Lung squamous cell carcinoma arising in a patient with adult-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
A 75-year-old male was admitted to our hospital in December 2011 with a mass in the right upper pulmonary lobe. He was incidentally diagnosed as having tracheal papillomas 10 years ago. Bronchoscopy revealed multiple polypoid papillomas in the dorsal lesion of the trachea. Polymerase chain reaction amplification detected human papillomavirus type 11 DNA in the papilloma tissues. A computed tomography scan demonstrated the occlusion of the right superior segment bronchus with distal consolidation. Furthermore, F-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography showed intense tracer uptake in the right superior segment of the lung. He underwent a right upper lobectomy. The tumor was seen as a rounded nodule, approximately 2 cm in diameter. Histological examination of the tumor revealed squamous papilloma with papillary and solid architecture surrounded by accumulation of acute inflammatory cells. Furthermore, in a part of the tumor, squamous cell carcinoma was also present. The lymph nodes were free of tumor. After the surgery, he continued to undergo endoscopic microwave resection. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a rare disease that can cause life-threatening airway compromise and malignant transformation. The present case indicates that F-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography is indispensable for early detection of lung cancer arising in a patient with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
