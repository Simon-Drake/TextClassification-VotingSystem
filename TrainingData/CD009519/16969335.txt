[PET in primary pulmonary or pleural cancer].
In our hospital as in many others, primary lung cancer is the most frequent indication for FDG PET. Studies have assessed the clinical utility of this imaging modality in characterizing solitary pulmonary nodules or masses, initial staging, defining tumor volume in radiotherapy and searching for recurrence of or restaging non-small cell carcinoma; studies are currently underway to evaluate its use in early assessment of chemotherapy response. Small cell lung cancer has a high FDG uptake and PET/CT can be useful for rapid staging. False negative results may be due to pure bronchioloalveolar carcinomas and endocrine tumors. FDG-PET will certainly play a more important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of pleural cancers in the future. An unexpected positive FDG PET focus should be considered as a warning, but histological proof should precede any irrevocable decisions.
