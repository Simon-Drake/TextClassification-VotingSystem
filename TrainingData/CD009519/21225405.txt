Intrapulmonary solitary fibrous tumor.
Solitary pulmonary nodules are sometimes detected by routine chest radiography. Although many of them are suspected to be benign tumors following noninvasive examinations including computed tomography and positron emission tomography, it is difficult to diagnose them accurately. This report presents a rare case of a solitary fibrous tumor located in the lung that could not be diagnosed preoperatively. More information must be accumulated concerning such rare cases of intrapulmonary solitary fibrous tumors.
