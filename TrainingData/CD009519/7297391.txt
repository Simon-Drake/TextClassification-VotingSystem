Radiologic examination of the chest in bronchial carcinoma. Results of an inquiry in the Netherlands.
Radiologic examination of the chest in patients with or suspected of bronchial carcinoma remains to play a key role in tumour detection and the subsequent management of these patients. As no uniformity exists about the type(s) of radiologic investigation of the chest, an inquiry was held among the radiologic departments of all major hospitals in the Netherlands in 1980. The results are discussed.
