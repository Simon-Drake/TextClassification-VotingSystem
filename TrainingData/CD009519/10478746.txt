Differential uptake of TI-201 by small-cell lung cancer in a patient with pneumoconiosis-related pulmonary nodules.
A 68-year-old man with pneumoconiosis was thought to have small-cell lung cancer based on the results of a biopsy of a bone tumor. Three pulmonary nodules were observed on a chest radiograph. Compared with a chest radiograph taken 4 months earlier, one of the nodules had grown. It was difficult to differentiate this nodule from pneumoconiosis-related benign pulmonary nodules from the appearance on the chest radiograph and CT. Ga-67 scintigraphy and TI-201 lung SPECT were performed to characterize these nodules. TI-201 SPECT showed differential high uptake in the enlarged nodule, whereas Ga-67 scintigraphy showed equally intense uptake in all these nodules. Transbronchial biopsy of the nodule that showed high TI-201 uptake revealed cancer cell nests against a background of interstitial fibrosis. The pathologic diagnosis was small-cell lung cancer that had developed in lung scar tissue. This case suggests the utility of TI-201 in scintigraphic assessments of pneumoconiosis-related pulmonary nodules when lung cancer is suspected.
