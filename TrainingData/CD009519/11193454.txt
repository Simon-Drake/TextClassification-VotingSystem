[A case of bone metastases from carcinoma of the lung demonstrating increased uptake of 99mTc-ECD].
A 48-year-old man with carcinoma of the lung had loss of consciousness during radiation therapy and underwent 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (99mTc-ECD) SPECT to evaluate brain tumor seen on CT scan. Incidentally 99mTc-ECD SPECT imaging showed intense accumulation in the frontal and occipital bone. The tumor in the occipital bone had been histologically proven to be a metastasis from carcinoma of the lung. We presented a very rare case of bone metastasis demonstrating increased uptake of 99mTc-ECD.
