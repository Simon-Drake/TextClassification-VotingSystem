[Quantitative and morphologic information value of the SPECT perfusion study of thoracic space-occupying lesions].
The results of planar perfusion scintigraphy, SPECT and CT were evaluated quantitatively and compared with each other in 47 patients with thoracic tumours. SPECT was superior to conventional scintigraphy in respect of morphological information. Quantitative evaluation of the function data derived from SPECT permits a more detailed anatomical recognition of perfusion inhomogeneity due to the tumour and can distinguish between central and peripheral tumour growth. Comparison between CT and SPECT showed good morphological agreement between the two.
