Tc-99m sestamibi uptake by cerebellar metastasis from bronchogenic carcinoma.
Tc-99m sestamibi has been used to detect primary brain and lung tumors. The authors report a patient who underwent brain imaging to differentiate tumor from abscess in the cerebellum because of a ring-like enhancement lesion on a brain CT scan. An abnormal area of increased sestamibi uptake in the right cerebellum was demonstrated planar and on a SPECT imaging. The removed tumor was confirmed to be poorly differentiated metastatic carcinoma.
