[(18)F]-FDG PET and localized fibrous mesothelioma.
The aim of this article is to present our experience with positron emission tomography (PET) and localized fibrous mesothelioma and to review the literature on this issue. During the past five years we found three patients with a complete clinical history who underwent a CT scan of the thorax and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]-FDG-PET) and were diagnosed with localized fibrous mesothelioma. Two of the patients were asymptomatic men and the third was a woman with chest pain. The standardized uptake value was 2.1 in one case, and in the other two an absence of FDG uptake was seen. All three had complete resection of the tumor, and in one case the presurgery diagnosis was adenocarcinoma. In one patient the tumor relapsed twice, and the other two patients are alive without any evidence of disease. The value of FDG-PET in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary and pleural abnormalities has gained ground during the last few years. As in most benign tumors, the FDG uptake is usually low (< 2.5) in the localized fibrous mesothelioma. However, more studies are necessary to define the role of FDG-PET in assessing this tumor.
