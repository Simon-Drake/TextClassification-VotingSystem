Alveolar adenoma of the lung: unusual diagnosis of a lesion positive on PET scan. A case report.
The authors report a clinical case of alveolar adenoma presenting as a solitary pulmonary nodule which was positive to PET and deeply located in the lung. Few cases of alveolar adenomas have been reported in literature; these lesions are considered pulmonary neoplasms with benign behaviour, usually presenting as a peripheral or subpleural coin lesion; the PET activities of such neoplasms were unknown.The present clinical case was singular for the deep location of the nodule and its tight adhesion to left inferior pulmonary vein requiring a lobectomy. In addition, alveolar adenoma PET behaviour has been reported as light positivity.
