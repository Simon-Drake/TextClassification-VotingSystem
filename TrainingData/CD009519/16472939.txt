Addressing glucose sensitivity measured by F-18 FDG PET in lung cancers for radiation treatment planning and monitoring.
PURPOSE: To address glucose sensitivity in lung cancers before and after radiation treatment (Tx). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients were each studied with two pre-Tx positron emission tomography (PET) scans and 3 patients each with one post-Tx PET scan, with glucose concentration [Glc] and maximum standard uptake value (SUV) recorded. The pre-Tx glucose sensitivity, g from SUV1/SUV2= {[Glc]1/[Glc]2}g and Tx index, tau from SUVpost-Tx/SUVpre-Tx = {[Glc]post-Tx/[Glc]pre-Tx}tau was calculated by linear regression. Pre-Tx SUVs were corrected to post-Tx Glc with g (SUV'pre-Tx) for a pure Tx effect, R = ln(SUVpost-Tx/SUV'pre-Tx). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in SUV but [Glc] were different (96.4 +/- 10.9 vs. 88.3 +/- 10.5, p = 0.015) between two pre-Tx PET scans. Linear regression yielded g = -0.79 and tau = -1.78 to -2.41 (p < 0.0005 in all). The %DeltaSUV after Tx for 3 patients without vs. with g correction were different by -12%, 0%, and + 7%, suggesting varying effects from glucose. R values were also different and mean R (-0.81 +/- 0.38) was significantly different from zero (p = 0.03), consistent with successful Tx as confirmed by clinico-radiologic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The extra dimension of glucose sensitivity, g besides SUV incorporated in the combined Tx-derived tau may be a useful global Tx evaluation index even with differing [Glc].
