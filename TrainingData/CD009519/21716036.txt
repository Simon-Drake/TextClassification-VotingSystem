Pituitary FDG uptake in a patient of lung cancer with bilateral adrenal metastases causing adrenal cortical insufficiency.
A 64-year-old woman with history of lung cancer and left adrenal gland metastasis was referred for FDG PET/CT to assess the response to target therapy and local radiotherapy treatment. In addition to bilateral adrenal gland FDG uptake lesions, the PET/CT also showed focal FDG uptake in pituitary gland with standardized uptake value of 3.9. Adrenocorticotropic hormone serum level was 439 pg/mL (normal <46 pg/mL), and serum cortisol level was 6 mug/dL (normal range, 5-25 mug/dL). The image and serum test results suggested the diagnosis of lung cancer, with bilateral adrenal metastases causing adrenal cortical insufficiency with secondary pituitary gland hyperplasia.
