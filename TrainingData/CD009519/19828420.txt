[Bifurcation resection of the left mainstem bronchus and segmentectomy for double granular cell tumors].
The authors report a case of a 57-year old asymptomatic patient, whose routine chest X-ray demonstrated a left-sided lung tumour. Bronchoscopy, chest CT and PET-CT revealed double granular cell tumours on the posterior wall of the distal part of the left mainstem bronchus as well as in the bronchus of the segment 6, in addition to the suspected malignant tumour in the 2nd segment. His surgical management involved the atypical resection of segment 2 lesion first, which was tuberculotic origin based on frozen section. Next, the double granular cell tumours were removed by segmentectomy of segment 6 and bifurcation resection of the mainstem bronchus. In case of granular cell tumours, resection of the mainstem bronchus is a safe procedure with good results. Further, surgical exploration is indicated in symptomatic patients with a suspicion of malignant coin lesions.
