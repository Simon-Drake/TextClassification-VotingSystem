Somatostatin receptor imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors.
Somatostatin analogs are used in the control of hormonal hypersecretion and tumor growth of patients with acromegaly, islet cell carcinomas and carcinoids. Recently we showed that somatostatin receptor positive tumors can be visualized in vivo after the administration of radioactive isotope-labelled somatostatin analogs. Receptor imaging was positive in 18/21 islet cell tumors, 30/31 carcinoids, 26/28 paragangliomas, 9/14 medullary thyroid carcinomas, 5/7 small cell lung cancers, 6/7 neuroblastomas, 38/49 primary breast cancers, and 0/18 pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Also 11/11 meningiomas, 4/4 astrocytomas and 0/3 glioblastomas could be visualized. Somatostatin receptor imaging is an easy, harmless and painless diagnostic method. It is an in vivo method for the recognition of neuroendocrine cancers. It localizes multiple and/or metastatic tumors, predicts the successful control of hormonal hypersecretion by octreotide and seems of prognostic value in certain types of cancer. This scintigraphic method might help in patient selection for clinical trials with somatostatin analogs in the treatment of neuroendocrine cancers.
