Pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma: the role of (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in monitoring response to treatment.
We report the case of 58-year-old man with pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma. He initially presented with cough, right-sided chest pain, and shortness of breath. Although the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism had been considered, chest radiograph and pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy showed a mass in the right hilum and no perfusion in the right lung. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (FDGPET) showed increased FDG uptake in the mass obstructing the right pulmonary artery. Fine-needle biopsy revealed a pathological diagnosis of pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma. The patient was successfully treated with radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. FDG-PET was used for monitoring the response to therapy.
