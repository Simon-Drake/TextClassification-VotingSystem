Prostatic metastasis of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung.
Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung is a rare and aggressive tumour with a poor prognosis. Lung cancer metastases to the prostate are also uncommon, and are usually found incidentally during autopsy. Most reported primary lung cancers with prostatic metastases are small cell carcinomas, and prostatic metastases from LCNEC of the lung have not been reported previously. This case report describes a 70-year-old man with LCNEC of the lung and metastases in the prostate, brain, bone, liver and lymph nodes.
