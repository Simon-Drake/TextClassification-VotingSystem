[A case of rapidly growing inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in the lung].
We report a case of a 28-year-old man with a dry cough and chest pain. Chest X-ray film showed a huge mass in the right lung field. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a huge mass which occupied most of the right thoracic cavity and invaded the superior vena cava, heart atrium and right pulmonary vein. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed metastasis of bone, right adrenal grand and lymph nodes. A tumor specimen was biopsied percutaneously, and the diagnosis was pathologically confirmed as an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Immunohistochemical staining also showed an overexpression of ALK in the tumor. He was treated with a non-steroid anti-inflammation drug and steroid, but they were ineffective. He underwent chemotherapy with bleomicin, etoposide and cisplatin. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the tumor slightly reduced in size, but was eventually refractory to the regimen finally. He also underwent with paclitaxel and carboplatin. At present, if operative extirpation is not possible, there is no way to treat an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. In the future, new therapy incorporating ALK inhibitors would be expected to treat those cases of IMT in which local recurrences and distant metastases occur.
