Evaluation of 2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoro-5-methyl-1-beta-L: -arabinofuranosyluracil ([18F]-L: -FMAU) as a PET imaging agent for cellular proliferation: comparison with [18F]-D: -FMAU and [18F]FLT.
PURPOSE: Clevudine (L: -FMAU) an un-natural analogue of thymidine, is in clinical trials for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV). L: -FMAU is phosphorylated by cellular kinases such as thymidine kinase 1 and deoxycytidine kinase, and its triphosphate form inhibits HBV deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. Thus, L: -FMAU, radiolabeled with an appropriate isotope, may be useful for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tumor proliferation. We evaluated [18F]-L-FMAU as a PET imaging agent in tumor-bearing mice and compared the results with those of two other radiotracers, [18F]-d-FMAU and [18F]-FLT. METHODS: Subcutaneous xenografts of the human lung cancer cell lines H441 and H3255 were established in mice. A micro-PET scanner was used to obtain images of the tumor-bearing animals with [18F]-L-FMAU, [18F]-D-FMAU, and [18F]-FLT. RESULTS: At 2 h postinjection, the tumor uptake (% ID/g) of 18F]-L: -FMAU, 18F]-D: -FMAU, and [18F]-FLT in the faster-growing H441 cells was 3.13 +/- 1.11, 7.74 +/- 1.39, and 5.10 +/- 1.45, respectively. The corresponding values for the slower-growing H3255 cells were 1.38 +/- 0.81, 4.49 +/- 1.08, and 0.57 +/- 0.33. Tumor/muscle ratios of accumulation for [18F]-L: -FMAU, [18F]-D: -FMAU, and [18F]-FLT in H441 cells were 4.15 +/- 1.82, 3.37 +/- 1.19, and 12.94 +/- 4.38, respectively, and the corresponding values in H3255 cells were 1.62 +/- 0.50, 1.96 +/- 0.74, and 1.50 +/- 0.90. CONCLUSIONS: [18F]-L: -FMAU may be a useful agent for imaging tumor proliferation in fast-growing human lung cancers by PET.
