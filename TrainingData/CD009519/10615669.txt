High-activity samarium-153-EDTMP therapy in unresectable osteosarcoma.
Despite highly efficacious chemotherapy, patients with osteosarcomas still have a poor prognosis if adequate surgical control cannot be obtained. We applied high-activity Sm-153-EDTMP therapy within a multimodal therapy concept to improve local control of an unresectable osteosarcoma with poor response to initial polychemotherapy. A 21-year-old woman with an extended, unresectable pelvic osteosarcoma and multiple pulmonary metastases was treated with high-activity of Sm-153- EDTMP (150 MBq/kg BW, total 8.1 GBq). Afterwards external radiotherapy of the primary tumor site was performed and polychemotherapy was continued, followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell reinfusion. Within 48 h after Sm-153-EDTMP application the patient had complete pain relief. After three weeks the response was documented by 3-phase Tc-99m-MDP bone scintigraphy (primary tumor and metastases: decreased tracer uptake), whole-body F-18-FDG-PET (primary tumor and metastases: diminution of glucose metabolism) and thoracic CT (metastases: reduction of size). The present case warrants further evaluation of feasibility and efficacy of this multimodal therapy combination of high-activity Sm-153-EDTMP therapy, external radiation, polychemotherapy and stem cell support for unresectable osteosarcomas.
