[Diagnostic imaging in lung cancer].
Lung cancer is one of the major causes of death as one of the most frequent malignant diseases in Hungary. Imaging examinations, especially computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission computed tomography (PET-CT) play eminent role in the detection, differential diagnosis, staging and follow-up of the disease. The purpose of this article is to review the role and efficacy of the available modalities and to define the diagnostic algorithm appropriate in different periods of the disease.
