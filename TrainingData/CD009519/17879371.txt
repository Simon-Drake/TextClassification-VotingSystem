Predictive and prognostic value of FDG-PET in nonsmall-cell lung cancer: a systematic review.
For several years, molecular imaging with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has become part of the standard of care in presurgical staging of patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), focusing on the detection of malignant lesions at early stages, early detection of recurrence, and metastatic spread. Currently, there is an increasing interest in the role of FDG-PET beyond staging, such as the evaluation of biological characteristics of the tumor and prediction of prognosis in the context of treatment stratification and the early assessment of tumor response to therapy. In this systematic review, the literature on the value of the evolving applications of FDG-PET as a marker for prediction (ie, therapy response monitoring) and prognosis in NSCLC is addressed, divided in sections on the predictive value of FDG-PET in locally advanced and advanced disease, the prognostic value of FDG-PET at diagnosis, after induction treatment, and in recurrent disease. Furthermore, the background and recommendations for the application of FDG-PET for these indications will be discussed.
