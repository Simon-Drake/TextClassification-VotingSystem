Intrapulmonary cellular schwannoma.
A 75-year-old asymptomatic woman was admitted to our hospital after an abnormal shadow was found on a chest roentgenogram. Chest computed tomography showed a round mass in the right lower lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the mass with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography showed high fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the mass. A lobectomy was performed thoracoscopically. The pathologic diagnosis was cellular schwannoma. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the presence of S-100 protein, and the Ki67 labeling index was 12%. We present this case of intrapulmonary cellular schwannoma, which is extremely rare.
