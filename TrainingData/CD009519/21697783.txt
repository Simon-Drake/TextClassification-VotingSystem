Efficacy of convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (CP-EBUS) assisted transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging in non-small cell lung cancer cases with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a sampling method for the patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes that are detected with computed tomography (CT). We aimed to investigate the value of EBUS-TBNA in sampling enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes in the patient with NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHOD: From January 2007 to May 2009, patients were diagnosed NSCLC with CT scans showing enlarged lymph nodes (node >1 cm) or a positron emission tomography (PET/CT) finding of the mediastinum underwent EBUS-TBNA. RESULTS: EBUS-TBNA was successfully performed in all 52 patients (mean age, 52 years; 45 men) from 93 mediastinal lymph nodes. EBUS detected lymph node metastasis in 40 patients (77%). 12 patients (23%) with negative lymph node samples were underwent mediastinoscopy. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of EBUS-TBNA in the detection of mediastinal metastasis were 95 %, 100%, 100%, 83%, and 96%, respectively. EBUS-TBNA was uneventful, and there were no complications. CONCLUSION: EBUS-TBNA is an effective, safe and minimally invasive procedure following PET/CT or CT scanning in the mediastinal staging of potentially operable NSCLC.
