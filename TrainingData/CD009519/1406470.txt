[Radioimmunoscintigraphy of colorectal tumors with 99m-Tc marked CEA antibodies. Indications and clinical value].
In Germany, radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) (scintigraphic, specific imaging of benign and malignant diseases by radioactively labelled monoclonal antibodies) has been employed since 1985 in clinical trials involving patients with colorectal cancer. After proving successful for identifying primary tumors, RIS is now increasingly being used for the early diagnosis of recurrent and metastatic lesions. In this prospective study involving 75 patients with colorectal tumors confirmed by endoscopy and biopsy, it was shown that RIS using the SPECT technique with 99m-Tc-labelled monoclonal CEA antibodies has a sensitivity of 78% in the detection of local recurrent disease in cases in which diagnostic work-up has been inconclusive.
