Radiographic staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in non-small cell lung cancer patients.
In conclusion, accurate pretreatment staging of NSCLC patients is essential so that they undergo the most appropriate treatment. Imaging studies play an integral part in clinical staging. The preferred imaging method for staging the mediastinum is PET/CT, preferably integrated. Until the sensitivity and accuracy of imaging studies are equivalent to the available MLN biopsy techniques, all candidates for definitive therapy require histologic assessment of the mediastinum.
