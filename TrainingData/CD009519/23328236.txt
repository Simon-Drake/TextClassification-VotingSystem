[Diagnostic value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging plus serum tumor marker assays for pulmonary lesions and clinical significance of SUVmax].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) plus serum tumor marker assay in lung cancer and explore the correlation between standard uptake value (SUVmax) with clinicopathologic factors in lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 177 cases of lung cancer diagnosed by radiography or computed tomography (CT) were recruited.(18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging and detection of three lung cancer related serum markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, CYFRA21-1 and neuron specific enolase) were performed within one week in all cases. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of those approaches were calculated through comparing the results with pathologic examinations. Also the associations between SUVmax and clinicopathologic features were analyzed. RESULTS: Among them, 145 patients were detected to have lung cancer by pathologic diagnosis while the other 32 patients had benign lung diseases. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging, serum tumor markers and their combination in assessing lung cancers were 89.7%, 78.1%, 87.6%; 89.7%, 78.1%, 87.6% and 96.6%, 56.3%, 89.3% respectively. The combination of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and serum tumor markers in lung lesions showed significantly higher sensitivity than serum tumor markers and (18)F-FDG PET/CT alone (P = 0.000, P = 0.002). Its accuracy was also significantly higher than those of tumor markers (P < 0.05). Compared with (18)F-FDG PET/CT alone, the accuracy was higher in combination group. But the difference showed no statistical significance (P > 0.05). SUVmax was significantly associated with tumor staging, tumor size and pathologic type. CONCLUSION: The combination of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and tumor markers may improve the positive diagnostic rate of lung cancer. And SUVmax can help to evaluate tumor staging and determine pathological types.
