Inflammatory pseudotumor suspected of lung cancer treated by thoracoscopic resection.
We report a relatively rare surgical treatment for two cases of inflammatory pseudotumors of the lung. In case 1, a 52-year-old male with a history of left chest pain was admitted to our hospital for an abnormal nodule with an irregular margin that was detected in the left upper lung field. The nodule, measuring 15 mm in diameter, was larger than the one observed six months earlier, which had been removed by a thoracoscopic resection. In case 2, a 64-year-old female with a history of chronic cough and hemoptysis was admitted to our hospital, and an abnormal nodule with pleural indentation was detected in the lower left lung field. The nodule, measuring 8 mm in diameter, was also removed by a thoracoscopic resection. In both cases, the histologic examination enabled us to diagnose the lesion as an inflammatory pseudotumor. In general, it is very difficult to differentiate inflammatory pseudotumors from malignant tumors of the lung. The best treatment for inflammatory pseudotumors is usually early and complete surgical resection, since it can lead to improved survival. Therefore, we consider thoracoscopy-aided surgery to be less invasive and more useful than other surgical methods in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory pseudotumor of the lung.
