The role of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastases in patients with extrapulmonary malignancy.
OBJECTIVE: The determination of mediastinal lymphadenopathy is important in the management of extrapulmonary malignancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of EBUS-TBNA in the diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in patients with proven or suspicious extrapulmonary malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed in 57 patients (81 lesions) with proven (n=51) or suspicious (n=6) extrapulmonary malignancies who underwent EBUS-TBNA between May 2009 and January 2011. RESULTS: There were 37 male and 20 female patients, with a median age of 64 years. Thirty-five (61.4%) patients were confirmed as malignancy (34 extrapulmonary malignancy and 1 primary lung cancer) and 22 (38.6%) patients were confirmed as benign. EBUS-TBNA identified malignancy in 30 patients. One patient who was diagnosed as primary lung cancer was excluded from diagnostic performance analysis. Overall cancer prevalence was 61% in 56 study patients. The diagnostic sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value of EBUS-TBNA per patient were 88%, 93%, and 85%. The diagnostic sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value of PET/CT scan per patient were 81%, 82%, and 71%, respectively. There were no serious complications related to EBUS-TBNA. CONCLUSION: Since mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy do not always result from metastases in patients with extrapulmonary malignancy, histopathologic confirmation is mandatory. EBUS-TBNA is a sensitive modality and can be considered as the initial test for the histopathological diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in patients with extrapulmonary malignancy.
