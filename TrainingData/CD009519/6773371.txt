Pulmonary nodules: detection in 1 and 2 cm full lung linear tomography.
Pulmonary nodule detection was evaluated in full lung linear tomography at 1 and 2 cm intervals. Three radiologists independently reviewed 1 and 2 tomograms on 26 patients with 39 pulmonary nodules. Decisions made in each case included: (1) no nodule; (2) definite nodule(s); and (3) suspect nodule(s). The presence of nodules was determined by surgery, radiographic follow-up, or observer consensus. A significantly greater number of nodules was detected by all reviewers on the 1 cm tomograms. Of the 39 nodules, 72%-97% were detected as definite and 82%-100% were identified as definite or suspect. Factors relating to nodule detectability and observer performance are discussed. It is recommended that full lung linear tomography be performed at 1 cm intervals.
