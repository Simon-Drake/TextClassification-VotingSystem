Impact of FDG-labelled positron emission tomography imaging on the management of non-small-cell lung cancer.
Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women in most Western countries. Although 5-year survival rates have doubled from 1960s, they are low compared with survival rates for other cancer types. Tumour stage is the strongest prognostic factor and the most important parameter that guides treatment decision making. Metabolic imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose-labelled positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has proved superior to conventional imaging for staging of non-small-cell lung cancer. This new imaging modality permits more accurate planning of treatment with surgery and radiotherapy and provides information of greater prognostic significance than what can be obtained with conventional approaches. FDG-PET has been approved in the USA and the UK as a basic and invaluable tool in the management of lung cancer. This paper reviews current trends in clinical practice on the applications of FDG-PET in the management of non-small-cell lung cancer.
