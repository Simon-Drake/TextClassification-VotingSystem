[Non-small cell lung cancer evaluated by first pass dynamic contrast-enhanced 16-slice spiral CT: correlation of tumor vascularity with pathological characteristics].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of first pass dynamic 16-slice spiral computed tomography in the evaluation of tumor angiogenesis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to assess its importance in predicting pathologic characteristics. METHODS: The first pass dynamic 16-slice spiral computed tomography was performed in 33 patients with NSCLC. Their peak heights (PH) were measured with dynamic evaluation software. Their angiogenesis were labelled by anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody. The first pass peak heights (PH) in 33 patients with NSCLC were compared with their microvessel densities (MVD) and their relationships were assessed by linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 33 patients with NSCLCs, the mean first pass PH and MVD of N1-2 were significantly higher than those at stage No (P < 0.01). The first pass PH of 33 NSCLC was correlated positively with MVDs. To differentiate stage N0 from stage N1-2 with 12 HU cutoff value of the first pass PH, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 88.0%, 75.0%, 84.8%, 91.7% and 66.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The first pass dynamic contrast enhanced CT may be a predictor of tumor angiogenesis in patients with NSCLC and its pathologic characteristics, and may be helpful to improve the accuracy of lymph node staging with conventional CT.
