The impact of computed tomography screening for lung cancer on smoking behaviors: a teachable moment?
BACKGROUND: Helical computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a potential screening test for lung cancer. An important component of care surrounding the use of this technology is the impact of screening on decisions surrounding smoking cessation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to conduct an integrative review of literature on the impact of lung cancer screening with CT on smoking behaviors of current smokers. METHODS: Ganong's [Res Nurs Health. 1987;10(1):1-11] guidelines were used to conduct this integrative review. Computerized databases were used to identify relevant articles. Data were extracted from the studies, and then content analysis was used to synthesize the findings. RESULTS: Nine studies were identified and reviewed. The quit rate among participants ranged from 6.6% to 42% after screening. Among current smokers, smoking abstinence was associated with older age, worse pulmonary function, and having multiple abnormal CT findings. Motivation to quit smoking, within the next 30 days, ranged from 14% to 35% among smokers. Factors associated with increased motivation were older age, lower nicotine addiction, fewer lung cancer symptoms, higher self-efficacy, and acknowledgment of the advantages of quitting smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Participants undergoing lung cancer screening had increased motivation to quit smoking. Computed tomographic screening for lung cancer appears to be a teachable moment to address smoking cessation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Screening for lung cancer is only one step to fight lung cancer. Incorporating smoking cessation interventions along with the use of technology is necessary to fight this deadly disease.
