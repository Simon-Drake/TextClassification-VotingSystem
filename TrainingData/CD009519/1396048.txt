[Spectrum distribution of ultra-weak luminescence of blood in lung cancer patients].
Using the single-photon counting detecting system manufactured by the Institute of Biophysics, Academia Sinica, the emission spectrum of ultra-weak luminescence of blood from 10 normal blood donors and 37 lung cancer patients were studied. The experimental results showed that ultra-weak photon emission of patients' was originated from the red region and three emission peaks were observed at 425-460, 535-595 and 620-660 nm. The intensity of photon emission at 425-460 nm of patient's blood was markedly higher than that of normal blood donors, with statistical significance. Furthermore, after operation, the spectrum distribution almost returned to that of what was seen in normal blood donors. Our observation shows that ultra-weak luminescence of blood may serve as an early detection of lung cancers.
