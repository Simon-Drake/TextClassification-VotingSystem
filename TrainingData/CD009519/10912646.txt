Approach to pulmonary metastases.
The prognosis and response to therapy of metastases to the lungs are variable and highly dependent on the origin of the primary tumor and on the extent and pattern of spread. Due to the complex pathogenesis underlying the development of pulmonary metastases, specific tumor types often display characteristic clinical and radiographic patterns. Understanding these concepts is of paramount importance when planning a diagnostic work-up for patients with possible pulmonary metastases. This review presents state of the art strategies in imaging, medical therapy, and surgery. It should provide the busy pulmonologist with the information needed to devise safe and efficient diagnostic and treatment strategies for patients with pulmonary metastases of extrathoracic origin.
