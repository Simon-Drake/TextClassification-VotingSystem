Early response to chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer assessed by [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography.
BACKGROUND: This study aimed to demonstrate that patients who exhibit a tumor metabolic response to first-line chemotherapy seen on FDG-PET and computed tomography (CT) would survive longer than those who did not show such a response, comparing this evaluation with the morphologic response seen on CT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Images were acquired in 22 consecutive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) randomized to receive carboplatin/paclitaxel/sorafenib or placebo. FDG-PET was performed within 4 weeks before (PET1) and 2 weeks after starting treatment (PET2). Similarly, CT (CT1) was performed at baseline and then every 2 cycles (6 weeks) during treatment (CT2). Responders and nonresponders were identified with FDG-PET, and metabolic response was then compared with morphologic changes detected by spiral CT. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 22 patients completed this study. In terms of progression-free survival (PFS) (45 vs. 22.2 weeks) and overall survival (OS) (77 vs. 47.7 weeks), we observed a trend that was not statistically significant for patients whose response after 2 weeks of treatment was seen on FDG-PET (P = .22 for PFS; P = .15 for OS). CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced NSCLC who had a positive outcome, as evidenced by prolonged survival, were those who showed a tumor metabolic response seen on FDG-PET.
