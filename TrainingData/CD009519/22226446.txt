18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and apparent diffusion coefficient in lung schwannoma.
Intrapulmonary schwannoma is uncommon and preoperative radiological diagnosis is rare. Described is a schwannoma that developed as a pulmonary hilar nodule in a 38-year-old woman. The nodule showed strong (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake with a maximum standard uptake value of 5.98 on positron emission tomography and had a high apparent diffusion coefficient (2.5 x 10(3) mm(2)/s) on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Combination of these functional imaging techniques warrants further evaluation in radiological diagnosis of intrapulmonary schwannoma.
