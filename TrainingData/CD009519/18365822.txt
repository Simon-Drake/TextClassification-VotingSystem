Visual scoring of atherosclerosis in chest computed tomography: findings among male construction workers.
BACKGROUND: Standard chest computed tomography (CT) examinations may contain valuable and underused information on atherosclerosis. PURPOSE: To study the retrospective scoring of chest atherosclerosis in CT studies performed for reasons other than cardiovascular. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Unenhanced CT images originally used for lung cancer screening of 505 male construction workers were retrospectively analyzed for chest atherosclerotic calcifications (coronary, aortic, and precervical artery origins). Findings were compared between those with a prediagnosed cardiovascular disease or diabetes (n = 180) and disease-free subjects (n = 325). RESULTS: Arterial calcifications (all) occurred among 96.6% of the subjects and coronary calcifications among 91.7%. The average total calcium score of the diseased subjects was 8.34 vs. 5.13 in the disease-free group (P<0.001). All calcification scores increased with age. In multivariable analyses, systolic blood pressure, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and smoking were generally associated with high scores, while high stature and high diastolic blood pressure were mainly associated with low scores. Nonsignificant positive associations between asbestos exposure and coronary calcifications were found. CONCLUSION: Our scoring method agreed well with preknown cardiovascular risk factors, indicating the method's usability. Chest CT examinations contain valuable information concerning atherosclerosis. This can be used epidemiologically or to reveal occult atherosclerotic disease.
