[Interest in 18-FDG positron emission tomography in radiotherapy planning: example of lung cancer radiotherapy].
18 FDG positon emission tomography provides metabolic images and allows better local and metastatic staging than radiologic methods. A best cartography of node involvement and a best delineation of the tumor zone should allow an optimal radiotherapy. Lung cancer is a good example of the interest of this new method.
