[Clinical case of the month. Case report of adrenal metastases from lung adenocarcinoma].
A 29 years old woman was diagnosed and lobectomized for a left upper lobe adenocarcinoma classified T1N0M0. Three months later a PET Scan revealed a lesion in the left adrenal which was then surgically removed and confirmed metastatic. Polychemotherapy and radiotherapy of the surgical site were started. Unfortunately four months later, a control PET Scan followed by biopsy showed a right adrenal metastasis which grew rapidly in site of the treatment. The patient died one year later in dissemination. We suggest that PET Scan should be performed before lung neoplasm resection. Unique and synchronous adrenal lesions should be removed because they do not respond any therapy. If these metastatic locations appear shortly after lung resection, according to this case and the literature, it seems that surgical resection is not useful.
