[Roentgeno-morphological comparisons in lung cancer].
An analysis of the clinical and X-ray data on 2,107 cases of morphologically-confirmed lung cancer showed a relationship between roentgenologic and histologic patterns of both central and peripheral forms of the lesion. Main roentgenologic symptoms versus histologic pattern of both forms of lung cancer are discussed.
