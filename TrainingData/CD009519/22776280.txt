Intrapulmonary schwannoma in the right middle lobe: a case report.
Herein, we report a patient with a rare disease, intrapulmonary schwannoma. The patient was a 61-year-old woman who had a 20 mm x 18 mm nodule, with a clear boundary and homogeneous content, on the central side of S4 in the right lung on chest CT. On PET with 18- fluorodeoxyglucose scanning, 18-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulations with a maximal standardized uptake value of 2.5 and 3.3 were observed in the early and late phases, respectively, suggesting a malignant tumor. A thoracoscopic right middle lobectomy was performed because the tumor was present in the segmental bronchial region of the middle lobe. Intrapulmonary schwannoma accounts for 0.2% of lung tumor cases, and cases involving patients who have undergone preoperative PET with 18- fluorodeoxyglucose scanning have rarely been reported.
