Multiparametric PET/CT in oncology.
The standardized uptake value (SUV) and other measurements of tumour uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET) can potentially be supplemented by additional imaging parameters derived either from the PET images or from the computed tomography (CT) component of integrated PET/CT examinations including tumour size, CT attenuation, texture (reflecting tumour heterogeneity) and blood flow. This article illustrates the emerging benefits of such a multiparametric approach. Example benefits include greater diagnostic accuracy in characterization of adrenal masses achieved by using both the SUV and measured CT attenuation. Tumour size combined with the SUV can potentially improve the prognostic information available from PET/CT in oesophageal and lung cancer. However, greater improvements may be realized through using CT measurements of texture instead of size. Studies in breast and lung cancer suggest that combined PET/CT measurements of glucose metabolism and blood flow provide correlates for tumour proliferation and angiogenesis, respectively. These combined measurements can be utilized to determine vascular-metabolic phenotypes, which vary with tumour type. Uncoupling of blood flow and metabolism suggests a poor prognosis for larger more advanced tumours, high-grade lesions and tumours responding poorly to treatment. Vascular-metabolic imaging also has the potential to subclassify tumour response to treatment. The additional biomarkers described can be readily incorporated in existing FDG-PET examinations thereby improving the ability of PET/CT to depict tumour biology, characterize potentially malignant lesions, and assess prognosis and therapeutic response.
