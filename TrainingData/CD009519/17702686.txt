[Screening for early detection of lung cancer: conflict between clinical and public health viewpoints].
In Hungary, lung cancer, gradually increasing among women, is the leading cause of cancer mortality. The screening, using chest x-ray and sputum cytology as screening tool, does not reduce the mortality from lung cancer, therefore, screening for lung cancer is not recommended. The low-dose spiral CT is a sensitive and promising method, however, its specificity is far from being ideal. The results of the on-going RCTs are expected in a few years time, and so far it is not applicable for routine screening. In this country, the one-third of lung cancer cases are detected by the routine chest x-ray for tuberculosis, obligatory by law, and most of the detected cases are still resectable, but this does not have any influence on the mortality. According to our view, the detection of the lung cancer, particularly in those at high risk, is a by-product of periodic chest x-ray aiming at early detection of tuberculosis, however, mass screening for lung cancer as public health measure is not recommended. For the time being, the implementation of tobacco control measures is the only way to reduce the risk of lung cancer in the long run.
