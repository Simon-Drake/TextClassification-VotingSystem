Haematuria as an uncommon initial presenting symptom of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to kidney.
A 47-year-old female presented with a 2-week history of painless haematuria. Urine dipstick showed moderate leucocytes. Blood and urine cultures were negative and cytology was negative for malignant cells. Flexible cystoscopy was negative for any bladder pathology. An ultrasonogram of the abdomen showed a mass in the left kidney. CT showed a mass-like lesion within the left kidney suspicious for renal carcinoma, and cavitary lesions in both lungs. Biopsy of the lung showed clusters of atypical cells suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and left kidney lesion showed malignant cells derived from SCC. A whole body positron emission tomography/CT showed lesions in the lungs, left kidney and skeleton. Complete clinical examination, laboratory and imaging studies did not reveal any site of primary tumour in any part of the body. Haematuria is a very unusual initial presentation of metastatic tumour to kidney.
