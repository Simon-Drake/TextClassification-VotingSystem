Impact of dual-time-point F-18 FDG PET/CT in the assessment of pleural effusion in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the utility of dual-time-point F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-18 FDG PET) in differentiating benign from malignant pleural disease, in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 61 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and pleural effusion were included in this retrospective study. All patients had whole-body FDG PET/CT imaging at 60 +/- 10 minutes post-FDG injection, whereas 31 patients had second-time delayed imaging repeated at 90 +/- 10 minutes for the chest. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUV(max)) and the average percent change in SUV(max) (%SUV) between time point 1 and time point 2 were calculated. Malignancy was defined using the following criteria: (1) visual assessment using 3-points grading scale; (2) SUV(max) >/=2.4; (3) %SUV >/= +9; and (4) SUV(max) >/=2.4 and/or %SUV >/= +9. Analysis of variance test and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used in statistical analysis. P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Follow-up revealed 29 patient with malignant pleural disease and 31 patients with benign pleural effusion. The average SUV(max) in malignant effusions was 6.5 +/- 4 versus 2.2 +/- 0.9 in benign effusions (P < 0.0001). The average %SUV in malignant effusions was +13 +/- 10 versus -8 +/- 11 in benign effusions (P < 0.0004). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the 5 criteria were as follows: (1) 86%, 72%, and 79%; (2) 93%, 72%, and 82%; (3) 67%, 94%, and 81%; (4) 100%, 94%, and 97%. CONCLUSIONS: Dual-time-point F-18 FDG PET can improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating benign from malignant pleural disease, with high sensitivity and good specificity.
