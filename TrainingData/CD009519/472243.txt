Computed vs. conventional tomography in evaluation of primary and secondary pulmonary neoplasms.
One hundred patients, ultimately proved to have chest malignancies, were evaluated prospectively with conventional chest tomography and computed tomography. In 58 patients with primary malignancies, conventional tomograms were more useful in evaluation of the hilus than CT scans. The mediastinum was better assessed by CT. Thus, evaluation of the presence of neoplasia is better accomplished by conventional examination, while extent of disease is best assessed by CT. Thoracotomy for curative resection was not attempted (in the latter cases of this series) based on CT findings of mediastinal involvement. In 42 patients with metastases to the chest, CT scans of the lung parenchyma were more sensitive than whole lung tomography but had little additional impact on patient treatment. Nevertheless, in 18 patients the results of CT or whole lung tomography directly affected patient therapy.
