High-riding superior pericardial recess: a pitfall in the upper mediastinum.
The high-riding superior pericardial recess is an anatomical entity both radiologists and respiratory physicians should be aware of. Recognition that this high-riding portion of the recess is of water attenuation, that it connects to the inferior portion of the superior pericardial recess, and that it does not exert mass effect on adjacent structures should help avert misdiagnosis and subsequent inappropriate treatment.
