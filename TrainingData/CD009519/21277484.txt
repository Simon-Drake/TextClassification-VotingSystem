[Ovarian metastasis from bronchial carcinoma].
INTRODUCTION: The ovary, being a richly vascular organ, may receive metastases from numerous tissues, particularly of gynecologic origin. Extragenital cancers are dominated by gastro-intestinal and breast tumors. The lung is exceptionally described as a primary site of ovarian metastasis. CASE REPORT: We report a 28-year-old woman who was found to have a right perihilar opacity. The diagnosis of small cell bronchial carcinoma was made by bronchial biopsy. A right-sided uterine mass was also identified. This was resected and histopathology identified it as an ovarian metastasis from the pulmonary tumor. CONCLUSION: We report, through this case, and present a review of the literature on ovarian metastasis originating from bronchopulmonary neoplasms.
