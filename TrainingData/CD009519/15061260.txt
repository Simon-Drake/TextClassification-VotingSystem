Comparison of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake with glucose transporter-1 expression and proliferation rate in human glioma and non-small-cell lung cancer.
To clarify the biological significance of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) accumulation in patients with cancer, we assessed the relationships between 18F-FDG uptake and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) expression and proliferation rate in human glioma and lung cancer. We obtained FDG PET images and measured standardized uptake values (SUVs) of primary tumours in 13 patients with brain glioma and 25 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. After surgery, portions of respected tumours were obtained, and the proliferation rate was measured as proliferation index (per cent of (S+G2+M)/(G0+G1+S+G2+M)) using DNA flow cytometry. The expression of GLUT-1 in a tumour was evaluated by using immunostaining. We classified GLUT-1 expression as grade 0 (no positive cell), grade 1 (< 10% cells positive), grade 2 (11-50% cells positive) and grade 3 (51-100% cells positive). Based on the expression of GLUT-1, cases with grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 showed SUVs of 6.1 +/- 2.8, 5.0 +/- 3.2, 8.3 +/- 3.3 and 10.4 +/- 6.6, respectively (P < 0.05). Non-small-cell lung cancer showed higher FDG uptake (SUV, 8.5 +/- 5.1) and higher GLUT-1 expression (grade, 2.0 +/- 1.0) than did brain glioma (SUV, 4.7 +/- 2.5; grade, 0.8 +/- 0.8). Based on the total number of cases, SUVs did not relate to proliferation index (r = 0.19). In non-small-cell lung cancer, SUVs did not correlate with proliferation index, whereas in glioma, SUVs were strongly related to proliferation index (r = 0.79, P < 0.01). In conclusion, FDG uptake generally correlated with GLUT-1 expression in non-small-cell lung cancer and glioma. In the case of glioma, FDG uptake also indicated increased cellular proliferation, which was not demonstrated in non-small-cell lung cancer.
