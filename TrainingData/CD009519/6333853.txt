[Tomographic densitometry of the human thorax].
We show the first clinical images obtained by a new tomographic system based on the detection of the scattered gamma photons of 99mTc by the chest tissues. These images show satisfactory contrast and tomographic effect on the half-chest near the radioactive source. Both effects tend to decrease on the contralateral half-chest. The images rendered important data in differential diagnosis of perfusion defects evident by lung scintigraphy with macroaggregated albumin labeled with 99mTc. Pulmonary density was normal and homogeneous in a healthy volunteer and also in a patient with pulmonary embolism. It demonstrated a hyperdense pulmonary mass in a patient with tumor of the right lung, which produced a perfusion defect evident in the conventional lung scintiscan, and a shadow in the gamma ray transmission image.
