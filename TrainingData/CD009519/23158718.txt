[Diagnostic value of (18)F-labeled NaF positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging in the detection of bone metastases in patients with lung cancer before treatment].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic values of (18)F-sodium fluoride ((18)F-NaF) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in the detection of bone metastases of lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 107 lung cancer patients were diagnosed by histopathology and undergone (18)F-NaF PET-CT imaging. RESULTS: Among them, the histopathologically diagnosed tumors included adenocarcinoma (n = 47), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 19), small cell lung cancer (n = 4) and other malignant types (n = 34). Bone metastases occurred in adenocarcinoma (n = 19) and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4).(18)F-NaF PET/CT imaging had a high sensitivity of 100% in the diagnosis of bone metastases with malignant lung tumors. And its specificity was 98.7%, accuracy 99% and positive predictive value 97.0%. CONCLUSION: (18)F-NaF PET-CT imaging can detect the bone metastases of lung cancer preoperatively with a high level of sensitivity and accuracy.
