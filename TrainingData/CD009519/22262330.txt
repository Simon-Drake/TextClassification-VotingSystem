[Occult mediastinal node involvement in non-small cell lung cancer after negative uptake on PET/CT: ripples through staging and therapy. Case report and critical review].
A 78-years old man, heavy smoker, with a persistent and hacking cough, was diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma of upper lobe of left lung. Clinical stage was defined as cT2N0M0 also on the basis of a negative (18)FDG-PET/TC. After lobectomy, pathological stage resulted, on the contrary, pT2N2M0. Because the considerable incidence of preoperative false negative uptakes of PET/TC for involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes, this case report is highlighted as emblematic, particularly in relation to post-operative treatment of early stage NSCLC.
