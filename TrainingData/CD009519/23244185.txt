Guidelines for the role of FDG-PET/CT in lung cancer management.
Fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is regarded as a standard of care in the management of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and is a useful adjunct in the characterization of indeterminate solitary lung nodules (SLN), and pre-treatment staging of NSCLC, notably mediastinal nodal staging and detection of remote metastases. FDG-PET/CT has the ability to assess locoregional lymph node spread more precisely than CT, to detect metastatic lesions that would have been missed on conventional imaging or are located in difficult areas, and to help in the differentiation of lesions that are equivocal after conventional imaging. Increasingly FDG-PET/CT is employed in radiotherapy planning, prediction of prognosis in terms of tumor response to neo-adjuvant, radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Evidence is accumulating of usefulness of PET/CT in small cell lung cancer.
