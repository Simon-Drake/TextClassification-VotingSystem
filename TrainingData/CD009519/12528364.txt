New approaches for biomarker discovery in lung cancer.
Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer death in the US and worldwide. Currently, there is no implemented population-based screening for lung cancer. Of all the markers identified, none have achieved sufficient diagnostic significance to reach clinical application. Here we discuss the status of lung cancer early diagnostics, and the genomic and proteomic approaches currently undertaken for biomarker discovery. We then introduce the ANTIBIOMIX approach that enables high-throughput target discovery by interrogating biological samples using a collection of thousands of polyclonal antibodies. The development of specific and sensitive diagnostic assays using patient's biological fluids, such as sputum and serum, will improve screening, monitoring of disease progression and treatment response, and surveillance for recurrence.
