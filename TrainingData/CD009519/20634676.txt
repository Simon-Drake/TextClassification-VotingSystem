A case report of complete remission of pulmonary metastases from epithelioid sarcoma to navelbine chemotherapy.
Management of soft tissue sarcomas can be very challenging because they have a high rate of metastasis, especially to the lungs, and respond very poorly to the currently available chemotherapeutic drugs. We present a case of epithelioid sarcoma in which complete remission of pulmonary metastases was observed after treatment with a single agent, navelbine, a vinca alkaloid, and a potential therapeutic agent. The patient has been persistently free of metastases for 4 years since treatment with navelbine. Further studies are warranted to establish the role of navelbine for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma and their metastases.
