Imaging bronchogenic carcinoma.
Imaging plays an integral role in diagnosing, staging, and following patients with lung cancer. Most lung tumors are detected on chest radiographs, but unfortunately, the majority of patients have advanced stage disease at presentation. There is a wide spectrum of radiologic manifestations of lung cancer, and recognition of these findings is essential for patient management. As we continue to understand more about tumor biology, new imaging techniques should emerge and have the potential to significantly improve our diagnostic capabilities.
