Small cell carcinoma of gastro-oesophageal junction with remarkable response to chemo-radiotherapy.
Small cell carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract is rare, and no effective strategy has yet been established. On the basis of regimens reportedly effective for small cell lung cancer, we performed chemotherapy with cisplatin plus etoposide in combination with radiotherapy to relieve obstruction, in a patient with small cell carcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction. Chemotherapy was switched to carboplatin plus etoposide due to renal toxicity. No distant metastases were detected and lesion spread was limited. A complete response, with no evidence of recurrence to date, was achieved. Curative resection was suggested but refused by the patient. He has been closely followed up in our outpatient clinic for more than a year and has shown no evidence of recurrence since the completion of treatment. Although cisplatin plus etoposide is a standard chemotherapy regimen for small cell carcinoma, carboplatin plus etoposide may be effective in cases in which cisplatin is contraindicated due to renal toxicity.
