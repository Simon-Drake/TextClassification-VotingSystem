Imaging in lung cancer.
The diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of lung cancer is a clinical and therapeutic challenge. Recent radiographic advances are critical to the management of patients with lung cancer. This review focuses on state-of-the-art chest imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography; magnetic resonance imaging, as well as the newest technique, positron-emission tomography, and discusses the current literature.
