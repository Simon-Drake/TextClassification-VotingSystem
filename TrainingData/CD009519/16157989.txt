Radiological and pathological correlation of lung malignant tumors treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation.
Radiological and histological correlation was evaluated in patients with malignant tumors of the lung that underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA). One of the patients had a primary lung tumor and another patient had three metastatic lung tumors. RFA was performed under computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopic guidance. CT showed ground glass shadows around the tumoral lesions immediately after RFA, but one week later homogenous opacification without tumoral enhancement was noted. Two months after RFA, most lesions showed cystic changes without activity on FDG-PET. Histological evaluation showed massive coagulation necrosis throughout the tumor and some viable cells at the peripheral areas in all lesions. Although RFA is a promising therapeutic approach for malignant lung tumors, some viable cells may persist in peripheral areas of the tumor.
