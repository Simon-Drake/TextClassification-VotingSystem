Thallium-201 SPECT depicts radiologically occult lung cancer.
A case of radiologically occult lung cancer is presented in which 201TI SPECT of the chest clearly delineated the involved area. A 66-yr-old man underwent chest screening examinations for asymptomatic smokers and presented a positive sputum cytology for lung cancer. Conventional chest x-ray, tomography of computed radiography, and a CT scan failed to locate the lesion in the lung. Thallium-201 SPECT, however, was successful in depicting the area of the involvement.
