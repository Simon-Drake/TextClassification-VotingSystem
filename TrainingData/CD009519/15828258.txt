[Primary neurogenous sarcoma of the lung; report of a case].
We report a case of a 27-year-old woman with primary neurogenous sarcoma of the lung. She had no symptoms but an abnormal shadow of the right lower lung field on the chest X-ray. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a well defined round mass, 20 mm in maximum diameter, at the right S9. Pathological study of the specimen obtained by CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy showed undefferentiated carcinoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) disclosed intensely increased uptake of fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) at the lung lesion without other abnormal uptakes. The patient underwent right lower lobectomy of the lung and mediastinal lymph nodes dissection. Results from immunohistological study yielded a definitive diagnosis of neurogenous sarcoma. Postoperative course was uneventful, and there has been no evidence of recurrence and metastasis for more than a year after the surgery. Reported cases of primary neurogenous sarcoma of the lung are reviewed.
