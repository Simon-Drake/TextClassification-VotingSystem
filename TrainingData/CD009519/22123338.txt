Extranodal manifestations of lymphoma on [(1)(8)F]FDG-PET/CT: a pictorial essay.
Lymphoma is the seventh most common type of malignancy in both sexes. It is a neoplastic proliferation of lymphoid cells at various stages of differentiation and affects lymph nodes with infiltration into the bone marrow, spleen and thymus. However, extra nodal involvement is frequently seen in many cases. With the development of dedicated positron emission tomography (PET) scanners with fused computed tomographic (CT) systems in the same gantry, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT has become a major tool in the evaluation of lymphomas and it is inimitable in certain situations such as assessment of response to therapy. Extranodal lymphoma can present with diverse manifestations and sometimes mimics other organ-related pathologies. Knowledge of the protean manifestations of extranodal lymphoma is required to accurately detect the disease and differentiate it from the various physiologic and benign causes of FDG uptake in various organs. We present a case series of extranodal involvement of histologically proven cases of lymphomas detected on FDG-PET/CT at our institute to demonstrate the challenges in interpretation of extranodal lymphoma.
