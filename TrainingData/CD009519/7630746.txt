[18FDG in the primary staging of lung tumors. Results with a gamma camera and a 511 keV collimator].
The diagnosis of primary lung tumors requires a precise staging according to the TNM classification. In contrast to established imaging methods 18FDG describes the functional metabolic processes in the tumor tissue due to increased glycolysis. This paper describes the use of 18FDG in the primary staging of lung tumors and metastases. 44 patients were studied with a gamma camera and a 511 keV collimator. In comparison to pulmonary tumors and metastases detected by other imaging methods (107) the accumulation of 18FDG has a sensitivity of 85%, in lesions verified by histology (50) of 89%, in primary tumors (35) of 100% and in metastases (63) of 76%. As an alternative to FDG PET studies, primary staging of lung tumors is possible with a gamma camera, suitable for ECT and fitted with a 511 keV collimator.
