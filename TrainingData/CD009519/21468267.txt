Pulmonary BALT lymphoma successfully treated with eight cycles weekly rituximab: report of first case and F-18 FDG PET/CT images.
Extra marginal-zone lymphomas of the lung is a very rare tumor and it originates from bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue. A 68-yr-old woman presented with productive cough and dyspnea. A thorax computed tomography scan showed a 9 x 10 cm in size mass in the left lung and pleural effusion in the lower lobe of left lung. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed intense uptake foci at the upper and middle sites of left lung and slight uptake foci at the mediastinal lymph nodes which showed malignant involvement. After bronchoscopic biopsy, the diagnosis of pulmonary bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) lymphoma was confirmed. At the end of the eight cycles weekly rituximab treatment, complete response was obtained by PET/CT findings. It is concluded that extended rituximab schedule is more effective and it would be beneficial to investigate the use of PET/CT in the diagnosis and evaluating of the treatment response of pulmonary BALT lymphoma.
