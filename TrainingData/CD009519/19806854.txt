Avoidance of invasive diagnostic and harmful therapeutic measures in a patient with malignant fibrous histiocytoma and extensive clinically occult metastases.
Malignant fibrous histiocytomas are rare soft-tissue sarcomas of uncertain histogenesis but represent the most common soft-tissue sarcomas in adults. In this report of a 70-year-old male patient suffering from this rare malignant disease, we describe the diagnostic benefits of combined functional and morphological imaging as realized in positron emission tomography and computed tomography, helping to avoid invasive diagnostic methods and, most importantly, harmful and quality-of-life-reducing, oncologically ineffective therapies.
