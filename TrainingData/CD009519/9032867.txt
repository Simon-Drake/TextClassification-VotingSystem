Irradiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors: analysis by positron emission tomography and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
To evaluate irradiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors treated by Gamma Knife radiosurgery, positron emission tomography (PET) and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies were performed on five patients. The tumor origins were lung cancer in three patients and breast cancer in two. Treatment volume was 0.4-10.1 cm3 (mean: 5.5 cm3). The marginal dose to the tumor was 24-30 Gy (mean: 26.2 Gy). The follow-up period was 5-19 months (mean: 13.4 months). No patients had conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. 18F-fluoroboronophenylalanine (18FBPA) or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) were used as tracers for the PET study. Using 1H-MRS, several metabolites were simultaneously measured in metastatic brain tumor and adjacent brain. In the PET study of the representative case, the uptake rate of 18FBPA that is actively transported to the tumor decreased markedly 15 days after radiosurgery and continued to decrease thereafter. In the 1H-MRS study, choline, which is characteristically high in metastatic brain tumors, also decreased over time. In two cases with suspected radiation injury, the enhanced region, which was decreased in size in early follow-up, enlarged progressively and was accompanied by edema. However, 18FBPA and 18FDG were not transported to the enhanced region. The peak of free lipid, which might show destruction of the cell membrane, was recognized in the enhanced region and adjacent brain in these cases. This study revealed that radiation effects on the metabolism of metastatic brain tumors occur at an early stage after radiosurgery and continue over several months. In particular, in the case of radiation injury, PET and 1H-MRS studies made it possible to distinguish between regrowth of the tumor and radiation injury.
