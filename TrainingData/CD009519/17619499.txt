Solitary pulmonary nodule.
Management of the solitary pulmonary nodule confronts physicians routinely. The key to management is to send patients with a malignant nodule for resection early, at the same time avoiding unnecessary surgery for patients with a benign nodule. After obtaining a thorough history and prior radiographs, the next best step is to obtain a chest CT. Depending on the probability of malignancy, the appropriate strategy can be determined and carried out.
