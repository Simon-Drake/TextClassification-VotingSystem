[Positron emission-computed tomography in diagnosis and staging of lung neoplasms. Personal experience].
BACKGROUND: Positron emission-computed tomography (PET) scans are obtained from the accumulation of a radiotracer in tissues with altered metabolism, such as malignant neoplasms. The authors present their experience with PET, performed in 50 selected patients with lung neoplasms in the 1998-2000 period. METHODS: The indications to PET corresponded to those most frequently reported in the literature, that is: diagnosis in solitary pulmonary nodule 8 patients; mediastinal lymph node staging, 16 patients; re-evaluation after neo-adjuvant therapy, 21 patients; increased markers blood levels in the follow-up of resected patients, 5 cases. Each indication is individually discussed and compared with the data of the literature, especially regarding the role of PET and its relationship with other noninvasive and invasive diagnostic tools. RESULTS: In 47 patients (94%) diagnostic yield was reached. A false positive (acute inflammatory lesion in solitary pulmonary nodule), a false negative (no demonstration of lymphangitic intrathoracic recurrence) and a non-diagnostic result (then pathologically proved non-neoplastic) were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Thus the authors consider PET extremely useful in the diagnosis and staging of lung neoplasms; the high cost of PET may be compensated for the reduced need for invasive diagnostic tools and, avoiding inappropriate surgical options, with favourable cost-effectiveness.Thus, PET may be indicated in most, if not in all, patients with lung neoplasms.
