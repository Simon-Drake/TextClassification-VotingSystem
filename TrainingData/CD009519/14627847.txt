Comparative impact of standard approach, FDG PET and FDG dual-head coincidence gamma camera imaging in preoperative staging of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
We prospectively compared the impact of the standard approach, of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and of FDG dual-head coincidence gamma camera imaging (DHC) in preoperative staging of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition to traditional staging, 42 patients were studied with a PET system and a DHC system. The number of lesions detected on DHC and on PET were compared independently of the proof of a tumoural invasion. Then, for the sub-group of lesions with the proof of a tumoural invasion, the sensitivity of the different imaging modalities was compared. Finally, stagings were compared with final staging established by histopathological findings (n=28), additional imaging modalities (n=4), clinical and traditional imaging follow-up over at least 4 months. DHC detected 105 of the 145 lesions considered as pathological on PET (73%, P=0.01), with a concurrence of 89% (NS) in lesions larger than 1.5 cm, and only 17% (P=0.03) in those smaller or equal to 1 cm. Traditional staging detected 87 of the 114 verified tumoural lesions (76%), PET 110/114 (96%, P=0.01 vs traditional staging), DHC 88/114 (77%, NS vs traditional staging, P=0.01 vs PET). PET correctly predicted the N stage in 39/42 (93%) patients, DHC in 38/42 (90%), and computed tomography in 32/42 (76%). PET correctly predicted the M stage in 42/42 (100%) patients, DHC in 41/42 (98%), and traditional staging in 38/42 (90%). Identical NM staging was obtained with DHC and PET in 38/42 (90%) patients. Compared to traditional NM staging, PET correctly up-staged 9/42 (21%) patients and down-staged 3/42 (7%), with one additional false N up-staging. DHC correctly up-staged 7/42 (17%) patients and down-staged 3/42 (7%), with one additional false N down-staging. PET correctly reclassified 4/42 (9.5%) patients from resectable to unresectable and incorrectly reclassified one. DHC correctly reclassified 3/42 (7%) patients without false therapeutic reclassification. Although DHC detected fewer lesions than PET, DHC is a possible alternative to PET since the impact on staging was high as compared with traditional staging and was very similar to that of PET.
