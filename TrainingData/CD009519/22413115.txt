Three synchronous primary tumors with different histology detected by (1)(8)F-FDG PET/CT.
The aim of this study is to present a patient with 3 primaries diagnosed with the (1)(8)F-FDG PET/CT study performed for the staging of endometrial cancer. Pathologic accumulations of the tracer were detected in both lobes of the thyroid gland, in the left lung and in the known primary of the uterus. A bilateral multifocal differentiated thyroid carcinoma and a peripheral carcinoid tumor in left lung were the final diagnosis as shown by histology. In conclusion, in this patient the PET/CT study performed for staging endometrial cancer demonstrated two new synchronous primary tumors. This is the second similar case but the first where all three primaries had entirely different histology.
