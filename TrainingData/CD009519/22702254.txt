Virtual 18F-FDG PET/CT bronchoscopy for lymph node staging in non-small-cell lung cancer patients: present and future applications.
Virtual (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) bronchoscopies provide virtually realistic, 3D endoscopic views of the airways combining anatomical and functional data at a high resolution. Today, even very small airways can be imaged by virtual bronchoscopy. (18)F-FDG PET/CT bronchoscopy images are generated from standard whole-body (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan source data without any additional radiation exposure. The purpose of this review was to give an overview over the studies that are currently available, to provide the technical background of (18)F-FDG PET/CT bronchoscopy and to explain the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT bronchoscopy. Moreover, this manuscript highlights potential future applications of this promising new imaging technique.
