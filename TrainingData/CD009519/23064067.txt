[Two cases of long-term response treated by S-1 with concurrent radiotherapy followed by S-1 treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients].
In a previous study, we reported a patient who responded to non-small cell lung cancer treatment with S-1 and concurrent radiotherapy over an extended period. This time, we report a long-term follow-up of the same case, and a new case which had a complete response to S-1 and concurrent radiotherapy. Case 1 is a 35-year-old woman with a pathological diagnosis of stage T2N2M0 lung adenocarcinoma. This case was already reported till 36 months postoperatively. 71 months postoperatively, PET-CT inspection revealed no obvious metastasis, unusual accumulations of FDG, or unusual shadows which may suggest recurrence. Case 2 is a 37-year-old woman with a pathological diagnosis of stage T2N2M0 right lung adenocarcinoma. After CBDCA/GEM and gefitinib were used as anterior chemotherapies, the right lung was partially resected. However, since the metastasis was developed, a total amount of 60 Gy/30 Fr was used to irradiate the mediastinum of the right cervix. Around the same time, S-1 treatment was started[a dose of 50mg/day(35m2/day)in two divided doses for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest). As a result of S-1 treatment with concurrent radiotherapy, the patient had a long-term response. Sixteen months postoperatively, there has been no observable recurrence by CT inspection.
