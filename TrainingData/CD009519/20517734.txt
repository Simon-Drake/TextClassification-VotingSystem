An old woman with weight loss and chest pain.
Pulmonary sarcomas constitute only 0.1-0.5% of all primary lung malignancies. These tumors may derive from the lung parenchyma, bronchial tree or pulmonary arteries. The most important entity in the differential diagnosis is metastatic synovial sarcoma. A 76-years-old woman was admitted for investigation of a fever, productive cough, dyspnea, weight loss and left-sided chest pain which had been present for one month. A chest computerised tomography showed enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were observed, as well as a left-sided pleural effusion. Thoracentesis revealed hemorrhagic pleural effusion which was exudate and lymphocyte predominant, closed pleural biopsy showed chronic inflammation. Left sided thoracoscopy was performed under local anesthesia, total collapse of left lung and multiple pleural nodules were observed on the visceral pleura multiple biopsies were obtained from those nodules. Pathologic examinations revealed "synovial sarcoma". As skeleton single photon emission tomography was unremarkable, primary pleuropulmonary synovial sarcoma was decided as diagnosis and chemotherapy was planned for the patient. Primary pleuropulmonary synovial sarcoma is a rare neoplasm of lung and pleura but it is rare entity.
