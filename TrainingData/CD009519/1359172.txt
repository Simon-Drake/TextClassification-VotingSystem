Production of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing hormone in various neuroendocrine tumors.
The concentrations of immunoreactive (IR) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in 218 neuroendocrine tumors were determined by CRH radioimmunoassay. The tumors examined were 86 pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET), 22 neuroblastic tumors (NBT), 26 carcinoid tumors (CA), 24 pheochromocytomas (PHEO), 40 small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) and 20 medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). IR-CRH was detectable in 21 neuroendocrine tumors (10 PET, four NBT, three CA, two PHEO and two SCLC) at levels of 10-2,700 ng/g wet weight (9.6%). The 21 patients with these CRH-producing tumors showed no clinical symptoms suggestive of Cushing's syndrome. The levels of plasma IR-CRH extracted by immunoaffinity chromatography were < 7.5 pg/ml in five normal subjects and a patient with a neuroblastic tumor containing 55 ng/g wet weight IR-CRH, but in a patient with a thymic carcinoid tumor containing 1,000 ng/g wet weight IR-CRH, the plasma level was elevated to 180 pg/ml. This patient did not have Cushing's syndrome nor an elevated plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level. The concentrations of nine peptides (growth hormone-releasing hormone, somatostatin, ACTH, calcitonin, gastrin-releasing peptide, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide, neuropeptide tyrosine and pancreatic polypeptide) were determined in extracts of the 21 IR-CRH-producing tumors. Some of these peptides were frequently found to be produced concomitantly with CRH. The results indicate IR-CRH to be produced by various neuroendocrine tumors, but Cushing's syndrome, due to the CRH, to be very rare. The results also show that CRH-producing tumors produce multiple hormones.
