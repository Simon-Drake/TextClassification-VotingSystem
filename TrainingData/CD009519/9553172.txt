A clinical evaluation of the quantitative accuracy of simultaneous emission/transmission scanning in whole-body positron emission tomography.
We present a clinical evaluation of the quantitative bias which is introduced during simultaneous emission/transmission (SET) acquisition for the application of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose. The quantitative accuracy of the SET technique was assessed by means of a clinical study involving 28 patients and a realistic phantom experiment. In the clinical study, SET overestimated the activity concentration in the tumours by a factor of approximately 1.10, but in the phantom study, where the tumours were smaller, the bias was found to increase to a value of 1.39. The bias in the soft tissue regions of the patient studies varied between 1.03 and 1.36, and close agreement was observed with the corresponding phantom results. The extent of the bias increased as the local activity concentration decreased and we attribute the effect to scattered photons from the transmission source which are detected in the emission window during SET.
