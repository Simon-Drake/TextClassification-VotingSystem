Colorectal tubulovillous adenomas identified on fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the significance of incidental focal colonic lesions on fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) scans in patients undergoing staging for noncolorectal cancer. METHOD: Of the 110 patients in our PET/CT database, 10 were found to have abnormally high uptake of tracer in their large bowel. RESULTS: Seven patients who underwent further endoscopic evaluation of these abnormalities had intermediate to high-risk adenomatous polyps. CONCLUSION: Benign colonic polyps produce high-intensity focal FDG uptake in large bowel. Endoscopic evaluation is recommended before curative resectional surgery of the presenting cancer where appropriate.
