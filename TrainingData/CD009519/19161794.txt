Placental transmogrification of the lung presenting as emphysema and a lung mass.
Placental transmogrification of the lung is a rare histologic subtype of bullous emphysema. We report a case of placental transmogrification in a 39-year-old man with dyspnea, mild hemoptysis, and giant bullous emphysema with an associated lung mass. Here we show that untreated placental transmogrification of the lung can lead to severe pulmonary symptoms and surgery is diagnostic and curative.
