[Abdominal pain during the course of lung cancer].
INTRODUCTION: Metastatic involvement of the peritoneum from a lung cancer is infrequently encountered. METHODS: We present the case report of a patient with bronchial adenocarcinoma whose course is complicated by the occurrence of a peritoneal carcinomatosis, as documented by FDG-PET. CONCLUSION: Unexplained abdominal pain in a lung cancer patient may be a peritoneal carcinomatosis. The diagnosis can be helped by PET-scan. However, the therapeutic opportunities are very limited.
