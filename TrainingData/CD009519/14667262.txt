A rare noncardiac cause for acute myocardial infarction in a 13-year-old patient.
A case of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in an adolescent patient is presented. The patient presented with resting angina and echocardiographic evidence of wall motion abnormalities in the inferior and posterior segments. The patient was known to have metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor was seen in the left inferior pulmonary vein and is proposed to be the source of embolism-causing myocardial infarction. Secondary to intracranial metastatic lesions, the patient was treated conservatively with opiates, nitrates, and beta-blockers. This case is an opportunity to review the causes and management of myocardial infraction in pediatric patients and represents a rare cause of embolic myocardial infraction.
