[A case of synchronous hepatic and multiple pulmonary metastases from rectal cancer responding completely to UFT therapy after resection of primary and hepatic lesions].
We report a case of disease-free survival with uracil-tegafur(UFT)therapy after resection of primary and hepatic lesions from rectal cancer. A 64-year-old female had synchronous hepatic and multiple pulmonary metastases from rectal cancer. Image studies including colonoscopy, CT, MRI and PET-CT showed 2 metastases of lung(rt. middle lobe and lt. upper lobe) and a metastasis of liver(S6)in addition to rectal cancer(Rb, pSM, pN1, ly2, v1). Abdominoperineal resection+D3 of rectal cancer was performed, followed by chemotherapy with UFT for 28 days, and then partial resection of liver. Resected specimens of the liver demonstrated a histological Grade 2 with many CD3-positive lymphocytes. After surgeries, chemotherapy with UFT was continued, resulting in a CR for pulmonary metastases. The patient has been well without any sign of recurrence 5 years after first surgery. This case indicated that UFT was effective for hepatic and pulmonary metastases from rectal cancer, partially due to T cells(CD3+)infiltrating the metastases.
