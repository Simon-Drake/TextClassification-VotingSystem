Can PET/CT replace separate diagnostic CT for cancer imaging? Optimizing CT protocols for imaging cancers of the chest and abdomen.
Stage-adapted treatment in oncology relies on correct tumor staging for patients with malignant diseases. To ensure accurate assessment of the tumor stage in thoracic and abdominal diseases by PET/CT, both CT and PET need to be optimized. In this setting, different malignant diseases require customized imaging protocols. Although in the clinical setting of therapy assessment, PET/CT with integration of low-dose, nonenhanced CT may be sufficient, tumor staging may require a more sophisticated CT protocol. This review focuses on potential CT protocols for imaging cancers of the chest and abdomen. Examples of CT protocols are presented and discussed for non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and interventional liver therapy.
