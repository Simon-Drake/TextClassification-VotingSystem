Late pulmonary metastasis of a rectal cancer resected 20 years after low anterior resection.
A 54-year-old man underwent a low anterior resection for rectal cancer in July 1986. A right pulmonary tumor was pointed out in March 2006 by screening a chest X-ray. Because pulmonary metastasis from colorectal cancer was suspected by transbronchial biopsy, a colonofiberscopy was performed. However, no primary tumor was found. Furthermore, positron emission tomography (PET) revealed no other positive lesion. This tumor was resected in April 2006, and the pathological findings, including immunohistochemical findings, were similar to those of the previously resected rectal cancer. This tumor was therefore diagnosed to be pulmonary metastasis from rectal cancer resected 20 years ago based on a comparison of primary and pulmonary tumors using immunohistochemical examination. This shows that pulmonary metastasis from colorectal cancer is possible even 20 years after the initial operation.
