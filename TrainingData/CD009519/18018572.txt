[Predictive value of serum thyroglobulin and diagnostic imaging in post-surgical follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer].
It is important to detect metastases of differentiated thyroid cancer after total thyroidectomy. Major sites of metastases are neck lymphnodes, lung, and bone. For this purpose diagnostic 131I whole body scan (WBS) and serum thyroglobulin (Tg) are important tools. If the WBS performed a few months after surgery shows metastases, treatment with high doses of 131I have therapeutic utility in patients with metastases. If patients are WBS(-) and Tg(+), PET-CT may be useful to detect metastases. If patients are WBS (-) and Tg (-), they are followed periodically by neck ultrasonography and serum Tg measurement.
