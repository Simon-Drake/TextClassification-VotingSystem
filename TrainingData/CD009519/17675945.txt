[Progress in radiation therapy and integration in Tenon hospital (AP-HP) of new advances in routine practices of radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer].
Much progress has been made in recent years in administration modalities for external radiotherapy of non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy with or without intensity modulation, with respiratory gated radio-therapy (4D radiotherapy), and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) can be considered as a third revolution in radiation therapy after total dose fractionation and the development of megavoltage radiation therapy equipment. We describe progress in the three-dimensional radiotherapy technique and the integration of this technique in the department of Radiation Oncology at Tenon hospital (AP-HP).
