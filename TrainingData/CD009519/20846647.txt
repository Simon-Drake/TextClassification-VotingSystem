[Endoscopic techniques in bronchogenic carcinoma. Changes in recent decades].
A 57-year old woman with arterial hypertension under treatment. She has smoked since she was 18 years old with an accumulated index of 70 years/pack. She was studied in our Respiratory Department due to constitutional syndrome, the X-ray showing an image of focal pulmonary lesion in the right upper lobe of more than 3cm of peripheral location. The computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the existence of a 3.3cm mass in the upper right lobe and detected paratracheal and subcarinal mediastinal abnormal lymph nodes. A subsequent Positron Emission Tomography (PET) confirmed pathological uptake of the mass and both lymph node locations. Which additional studies do you consider to be indicated for a correct diagnosis and mediastinal staging? Do bronchoscopy techniques alone establish the final diagnosis and staging of this patient?
