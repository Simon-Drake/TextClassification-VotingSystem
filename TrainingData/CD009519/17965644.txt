Radioactive iodine therapy in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer.
BACKGROUND: A 55-year-old male was diagnosed with poorly differentiated thyroid cancer after total thyroidectomy, which was performed because of progressive enlargement of a dominant thyroid nodule. He developed an early cervical recurrence that was treated with modified neck dissection. He subsequently developed biopsy-proven progressive pulmonary metastases. INVESTIGATIONS: Neck and chest CT scans, laboratory tests, CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy, [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET scan, lesional dosimetry using 124I PET scan, diagnostic radioactive iodine (RAI) scanning, whole-body and blood RAI dosimetry, and single-photon-emission CT. DIAGNOSIS: Stage IV poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. MANAGEMENT: Surgical resection of cervical recurrence, RAI therapy.
