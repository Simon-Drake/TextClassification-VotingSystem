Baastrup's disease (kissing spine) demonstrated by FDG PET/CT.
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) is a widely used imaging modality in cancer patients. However, there are many potential non-neoplastic causes of FDG uptake. We report a case of FDG uptake between the spinous processes, secondary to Baastrup's disease. Knowledge of this pattern of uptake is helpful in diagnosing Baastrup's disease and avoiding false-positive diagnoses.
