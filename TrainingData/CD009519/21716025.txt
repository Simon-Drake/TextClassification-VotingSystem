Images of a case of Carney triad by combined F-18 FDG PET/CT.
Carney triad is a very rare condition with gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paragangliomas. We present the images of a patient with the complete triad, including total gastrectomy for gastrointestinal stromal tumor at the age of 13, and a left pneumonectomy for pulmonary chondroma at the age of 15. Results of F-18 FDG PET/CT that was performed at age of 22 for recurrent pulmonary chondroma also demonstrated new lesions in the neck, mediastinum, and abdomen representing extra-adrenal paragangliomas.
