Non-small-cell lung cancer.
In the decade since the last Lancet Seminar on lung cancer there have been advances in many aspects of the classification, diagnosis, and treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An international panel of experts has been brought together to focus on changes in the epidemiology and pathological classification of NSCLC, the role of CT screening and other techniques that could allow earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of the disease, and the recently introduced seventh edition of the TNM classification and its relation to other prognostic factors such as biological markers. We also describe advances in treatment that have seen the introduction of a new generation of chemotherapy agents, a proven advantage to adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection for specific stage groups, new techniques for the planning and administration of radiotherapy, and new surgical approaches to assess and reduce the risks of surgical treatment.
