Uptake decrease of proliferative PET tracer 18FLT in bone marrow after carbon ion therapy in lung cancer.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the change of 3'-[(1)(8)F]fluoro-3'-deoxy-L: -thymidine ((1)(8)FLT) uptake in normal bone marrow (BM) after inevitable radiation. PROCEDURES: Twenty-one non-small cell lung cancer patients who received carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) were studied with (1)(8)FLT-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) at pre- and post-CIRT. Radiation dose was calculated by radiation planning. Irradiated BM was divided into three groups (<10% of maximum dose, 10-30%, and >30%). RESULTS: (1)(8)FLT uptake clearly decreased at >10% irradiated areas and mildly decreased at <10% areas. (1)(8)FLT uptake was lowest just after CIRT, somewhat increased at 3 months, and remained unchanged for more than 1 year. There was no significant difference between 10-30% and >30% areas. CONCLUSION: (1)(8)FLT revealed that BM function decreased by small dose such as <4.2-4.4 GyE/1 fraction of CIRT and is eradicated by >4.2-4.4 GyE/1 fraction.
