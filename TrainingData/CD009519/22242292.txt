[Small size lung adenocarcinoma with rocal recurrence and port site recurrence 56 months after partial resection].
A lobectomy with systemic lymphadenectomy is a standard surgical procedure for a resectable lung cancer. However there is not a consensus on the limited surgery. A 60-year-old man underwent left upper lobe partial resection for small size lung adenocarcinoma under video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Fifty-six months after the operation, a computed tomography (CT) scan showed a local recurrence on the staple-line. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed an additional port site recurrence, which wasn't showed by a CT scan. He underwent left upper lobectomy and port site resection.
