Elevated FDG uptake in right middle segmental bronchus impacted with foreign body.
A 62-year-old man with recurrent episodes of coughing underwent a whole-body FDG PET/CT scan to evaluate possible lung malignancy. The PET images showed increased FDG uptake in the right side of the bronchus corresponding to a foreign body on the concurrent CT images. The foreign body was subsequently removed through bronchofiberscopy and was proven to be a fishbone.
