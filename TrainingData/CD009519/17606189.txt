Preoperative imaging for metastasectomy.
For most solid neoplasms, medical imaging is a vital component of tumor staging and surveillance. Imaging strategies vary according to the type and grade of primary neoplasm, tumor stage at diagnosis, tumor markers, previous therapies, and patient symptoms. In this article, we address imaging of individual organs (lung, liver, adrenals) and outline imaging strategies for specific types of neoplasms.
