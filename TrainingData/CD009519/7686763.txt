Positron emission tomography (PET) in neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors.
Positron emission tomography (PET) makes it possible to study effects of medical treatment in vivo. Carcinoid tumors with liver metastases, especially those of midgut origin, produce serotonin via the precursors tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and this overproduction contributes to the clinical symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome. Seven patients with histopathologically verified neuroendocrine tumors and liver metastases, five of whom with ileal carcinoids, one a lung carcinoid and one an endocrine pancreatic tumor, were included in the study. All patients had elevation of urinary 5-HIAA with the exception of one patient with a solitary liver metastasis of midgut origin. After an intravenous injection of 11C-5-HTP, PET was performed and the uptake of radioactivity in tumor tissue, normal liver and plasma were compared. All patients with elevated urinary 5-HIAA and also the patient with a solitary liver metastasis and normal urinary 5-HIAA had high accumulation and signs of a high rate of binding of 5-HTP in the liver metastases. The uptake was relatively homogeneous in midgut carcinoid liver metastases but in large necrotic metastases the radioactivity was localized to the periphery. In three patients PET examination was repeated after 3 months of interferon treatment and in agreement with circulating tumor markers and ultrasonography the uptake of 5-HTP was unchanged. Another patient who received the somatostatin analog somatuline progressed on treatment and accordingly the uptake of 5-HTP also increased. The experience with PET in neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors is very limited. Our results so far indicate that 5-HTP can be used to visualize serotonin-producing neuroendocrine tumors and furthermore it might prove to be of value to monitor the effects of treatment, possibly also as an early predictive test of the outcome of treatment.
