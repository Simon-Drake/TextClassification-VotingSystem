[FDG PET scan of metastases in recurrent medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland].
Searching for metastases of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), FDG PET was applied. PET results were compared with those of conventional diagnostic imaging procedures. After primary treatment, 52 MTC patients with elevated serum tumor marker levels and/or general symptoms (diarrhoea/flush) underwent radiological (CT/MRI), 131-iodine labeled metaiodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) whole-body scintigraphy and FDG PET investigations. At least one pathological lesion was detected in 49 patients by PET, 35 by CT, 32 by MRI and 3 by MIBG. FDG PET was far superior to the other methods in identifying metastases in the supradiaphragmatic lymphatic regions. In the follow-up of MTC patients, FDG PET was more sensitive in localizing tumorous LN involvement, especially in the cervical, supraclavicular and mediastinal lymphatic regions, compared to other imaging modalities.
