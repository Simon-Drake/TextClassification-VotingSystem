Change of cerebral glucose metabolism by antineoplastic drug.
To estimate change of cerebral glucose metabolism by anticancer drugs, positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was performed in 11 patients with malignancies who did not show neurological symptoms. In a patient treated with intravenous high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and intrathecal MTX, apparent decrease of glucose metabolism was observed. HD-MTX and intrathecal MTX may cause cerebral glucose metabolism disorder primarily. Cerebral glucose metabolism was also mildly reduced by chemotherapy with drugs other than MTX and by radiotherapy outside the brain, with a corresponding change of blood data. It may reflect a psychosomatic change in whole body.
