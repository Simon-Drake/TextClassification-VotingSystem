Integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: normal variants and pitfalls.
The purpose of this pictorial essay is to illustrate a spectrum of normal variants and potential pitfalls in integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging in the evaluation of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Knowledge of the normal variants and potential pitfalls in PET/CT imaging as well as patients' clinical histories, together with the use of CT to localize foci of increased tracer uptake accurately, is useful in preventing misinterpretation.
