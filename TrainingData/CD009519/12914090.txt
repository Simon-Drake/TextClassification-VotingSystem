[The advantages of depreotide in the diagnosis of spherical solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN): preliminary study].
The affinity of various malignant neoplasms including small cell and non-small cell lung cancer for peptide analogue of somatostatin has been documented. Depreotide is such an analogue and can be combined with technetium--99m (99mTc depreotide) for optical imaging properties. Using this radiopharmaceutical product, solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) were previously successful evaluated. In this article the preliminary study of the depreotide (NeoSpect--Amersham, Wielka Brytania) in clinical practice has been shown.
