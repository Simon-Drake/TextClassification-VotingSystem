18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography as a tool for response prediction in solid tumours.
Current response guidelines for the treatment of solid tumours are based on CT criteria. Over the last decades new techniques have emerged to evaluate cancer therapy. FDG-PET scanning is a more functional imaging technique, which can measure differences in metabolic activity. Although it has a low specificity, studies show that it can outperform classical CT scanning criteria. Especially in lung, breast and oesophageal cancer it can predict response earlier in the neo-adjuvant setting. This could reduce the use of ineffective cancer therapies, reducing costs and patient toxicity, and direct patients sooner towards effective therapy. The main problem with FDG-PET remains the difficulty in defining thresholds for response, as there is clearly a lack in large prospective randomized studies validating the use of FDG-PET in response guidelines.We give an overview of data on response prediction in solid tumours by the application of PET.
