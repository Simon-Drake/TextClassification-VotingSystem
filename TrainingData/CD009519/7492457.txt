Imaging and staging of small-cell lung cancer: is there a future role for octreotide scintigraphy?
In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), CT scan remains the most accurate imaging modality for evaluating local extension and specific sites of metastatic disease. The role of nuclear medicine in the work-up of SCLC is still limited to the detection of bone metastases. Recently, a new potential diagnostic tool has been introduced based on the presence of somatostatin receptors in SCLC. With the use of radiolabelled somatostatin analogues it is hoped that an equally effective but simpler staging system has been found that gives a better separation of prognostic subgroups. This article reviews the role of nuclear medicine in general and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in particular in the imaging and staging of SCLC. Clinical value in terms of sensitivity and specificity is discussed in relation with other imaging and staging modalities.
