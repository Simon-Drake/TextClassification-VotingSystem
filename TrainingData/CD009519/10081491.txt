Role of sialylglycoconjugate(s) in the initial phase of metastasis of liver-metastatic RAW117 lymphoma cells.
To elucidate the early events of blood-borne metastasis under actual blood flow, real-time trafficking of RAW117 large cell lymphoma cells, namely parental RAW117-P and liver-metastatic RAW117-H10 cells, was investigated using positron emission tomography (PET). Both types of cells accumulated in the liver immediately after injection via the portal vein, and were eliminated from the liver time-dependently. The elimination rate of RAW117-H10 cells, however, was slower than that of RAW117-P cells, suggesting that RAW117-H10 cells interact more strongly with hepatic sinusoidal endothelium than the parental cells. This result correlated with the metastatic potential of these cells: RAW117-H10 cells metastasized in the liver to a greater extent than RAW117-P cells after injection via this route. To investigate the role of sialylglycoconjugates in the interaction of RAW117-H10 cells with the hepatic endothelium after injection via the portal vein, the trafficking of RAW117-H10 cells was examined after the cells had been treated with sialidase. The elimination rate of RAW117-H10 cells from liver was observed to be greatly accelerated by sialidase treatment. To elucidate what kind of sialylglycoconjugates is related to this phenomenon, we analyzed the distribution of sialyl Lewis A and sialyl Lewis X antigens of both sublines of RAW117 by using flow cytometry. RAW117-H10 cells were found to express a much higher level of sialyl Lewis A than RAW117-P cells, whereas the amount of sialyl Lewis X did not differ significantly. These findings suggest that some sialylglycoconjugates, perhaps sialyl Lewis A in particular, play an important role in the initial interaction of RAW117-H10 cells with the hepatic endothelium, leading to metastasis.
