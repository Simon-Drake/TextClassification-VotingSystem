[A case of local recurrence of rectal cancer in which trans-sacral resection and perineal reconstruction by femoral posterior flap were performed].
A 54-year-old woman underwent abdomino-perineal resection for rectal cancer. Six months after surgery, perineal pain and the tumor marker increased. Local recurrence of the pelvic cavity and lung metastases were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) and positoron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-fluorodeoxygulucose (FDG). Local perineal pain continued and there was no increase in the neoplastic lesion of the lung, so surgical treatment was performed. After partial resection of the lung, local resection of the gluteus maximus and posterior wall of the vagina was performed with the patient in the Jack-knife position. To fill the defect, a femoral posterior flap was made and the perineal defect was reconstructed.
