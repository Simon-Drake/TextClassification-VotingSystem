Endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide-sheath and virtual bronchoscopy navigation aids management of peripheral pulmonary nodules.
Occasionally, we have difficulty in diagnosing small peripheral pulmonary nodules. However, efforts have been made to resolve this problem. For instance, computed-tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), flexible bronchoscopy examination (BF), and video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) have been performed to investigate such nodules. We have used endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide-sheath (EBUS-GS) for BF examination, and recently applied the virtual reality technique "virtual bronchoscopy (VB)". Here, we present a case in which a combined technique with VB and EBUS-GS was useful. The patient was a 54-year-old man with a persistent cough and chest pain. Small nodules were seen in the bilateral lungs on the chest CT taken at the local hospital. A slight increase in the CEA level (6.1 ng/ml; normal level < 5.0 ng/ml) was shown as well as an uptake in the latter term on PET. As a result, he was referred to our hospital for a detailed work-up. We applied VB to confirm the location of the tumor, which allowed us to approach the lesion easily. Furthermore, we precisely localized the lesion using EBUS-GS. Then a biopsy was performed, which demonstrated bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). As seen in this case, combining VB and EBUS-GS seems beneficial for diagnosing peripheral pulmonary nodules.
