[CT-guided interstitial brachytherapy of lung malignancies. Technique and first results].
CT-guided interstitial brachytherapy of lung malignancies is a novel technique combining (192)Iridium brachytherapy with modern CT guidance for applicator positioning and 3D dosimetry. Initially, this technique has been developed for the treatment of liver malignancies. In the following we describe this novel technique as well as initial results for the treatment of lung malignancies.
