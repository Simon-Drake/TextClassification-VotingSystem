Benign metastasizing leiomyoma of the lung: PET findings.
We report the case of pulmonary benign metastasizing leiomyoma in an asymptomatic 64-year-old woman who underwent hysterectomy for a uterine leiomyoma 26 years earlier. Routine chest radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse nodular opacities within the pulmonary lobes. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan showed peripheral lung nodules that do not display contrast enhancement. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG PET-CT) demonstrated no significant metabolic activity of the nodules. The lesions were diagnosed as benign metastasizing leiomyoma by histopathologic examination. To our best knowledge, this is the first case studied combining CT and FDG PET-CT technique.
