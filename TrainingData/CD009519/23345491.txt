Illustrative cases of false positive biopsies after stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung cancer based on abnormal FDG-PET-CT imaging.
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early stage lung cancer has made significant strides as an alternative to surgery.1 We present two cases of non-small cell lung cancer treated with SBRT and then followed serially with imaging in which suspicion of recurrence led to biopsies.
