A case of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma surviving 10 years without treatment.
A 19-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of bilateral multiple nodular shadows on the chest radiograph. She complained of no symptoms. The pulmonary lesions were diagnosed pathologically as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. She has been followed without treatment for more than 10 years. Among all lesions, only two pulmonary nodules enlarged slightly, and it is interesting that one showed significant uptake in a fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan. The current case suggests the clinical usefulness of an FDG-PET scan in a pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH) patient.
