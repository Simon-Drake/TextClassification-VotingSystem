Preferential accumulation of (3)H-tetraphenylphosphonium in non-small cell lung carcinoma in mice: comparison with (99m)Tc-MIBI.
UNLABELLED: We have previously shown enhanced accumulation of the delocalized lipophilic cation (11)C-triphenylmethylphosphonium in canine brain glioma, suggesting its potential use for tumor staging in humans using PET. Here, we extend our studies of phosphonium cations to nonbrain tumors and characterize the biodistribution and tumor specificity of (3)H-tetraphenylphosphonium ((3)H-TPP) in non-small cell lung carcinoma in mice. METHODS: (3)H-TPP accumulation in isolated malignant lung nodules of the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line, in LLC-bearing lung, and in control lung was measured at various intervals after inoculation. Tumor uptake and biodistribution of (3)H-TPP were compared with those of (99m)Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI). RESULTS: (3)H-TPP accumulation in LLC nodules at 14 d was significantly greater than that in controls, peaked at 21 d, and declined to lower values at 28 d after injection. At 21 d after injection, (3)H-TPP uptake in LLC nodules was greater than that in control lung tissue and in LLC-bearing lung tissue-by 549% and 230%, respectively-whereas (99m)Tc-MIBI nodule uptake was greater by 90% and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The high tumor accumulation and sensitivity to the phase of tumor development suggest the potential use of radiolabeled phosphonium analogs for in vivo tumor staging and as a tool for investigating tumor evolution.
