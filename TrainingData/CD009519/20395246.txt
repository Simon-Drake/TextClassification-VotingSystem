A rare association; pulmonary blastoma developing on extrapulmonary sequestration basis.
Pulmonary blastoma (PB) is a thoracopulmonary mesenchymal disembryogenic neoplasm which is rarely seen and generally in childhood. Pulmonary sequestration is one of the less observed congenital malformations. A 45-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with PB, histopathologically developed on atypically placed extrapulmonary sequestration in the left upper zone is presented in this study.
