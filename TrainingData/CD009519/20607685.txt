Pitfalls in pulmonary cytopathology.
Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed major cancer. Fine-needle aspiration of lung lesions is a reliable test with a high diagnostic yield, high sensitivity, and high specificity, yet differentiation of reactive pulmonary processes from neoplasms and subclassification of lung neoplasms often poses difficult diagnostic dilemmas. This review outlines potential pitfalls in pulmonary cytology and presents diagnostic tools to assist in the accurate diagnosis.
