Lung cancer.
Lung cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer in the world, and in the United States it is the second most common cancer diagnosed. Accurate staging by imaging can have a significant impact on appropriate treatment and surgical options. Familiarity with the different histologic subtypes of lung cancer and the typical and atypical appearances of lung cancer is vital. Radiologists serve a critical role in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of patients with lung cancer.
