[A case of advanced mullerian cancer successfully treated with S-1 chemotherapy].
A 79-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with complaints of dyspnea. She was diagnosed with massive pleural effusion and cytology demonstrated the presence of adenocarcinoma, but no solid tumors were found in the systemic examination. Her serum CYFRA and CA125 level were increased. She was diagnosed with an effusion type of lung cancer or a cancer of unknown origin. S-1/CDDP was the chemotherapy of choice. After 2 courses of the treatment, her serum CYFRA level and CA125 level were normalized, and a chest CT detected no pleural effusion. Two years and 3 months after the first treatment, her CA125 level was increased. We found an FDG accumulation in her pelvic lesion by PET examination. To identify the FDG accumulated lesion in her pelvis, an operation was performed. Histopathological examination of the right ovary demonstrated the presence of an adenocarcinoma. Postoperatively, we administered 2 courses of paclitaxel/carboplatin combination treatment, considering the right ovarian tumor was the primary lesion. The patient remained alive and in good condition without any signs of recurrence 2 years after second treatment. This case suggests that S-1 therapy may be effective for patients with mullerian cancer.
