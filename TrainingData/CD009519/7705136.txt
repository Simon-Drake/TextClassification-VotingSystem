Detection of scalene lymph node metastases from lung cancer. Positron emission tomography.
Preliminary data indicate that positron emission tomography (PET) following injection of fluorodeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) is sensitive and specific for detecting malignant cells in chest tumors and mediastinal lymph nodes. We report a case of non-small cell lung cancer metastatic to clinically normal scalene lymph nodes that was correctly staged by FDG-PET.
