Lung and pleural fibrosis in asbestos-exposed workers: a risk factor for pneumonia mortality.
Lungs exposed to occupational dust may be especially vulnerable to fatal infections. We followed up asbestos-exposed workers (n=590) originally screened for lung cancer with computed tomography and scored for pleuropulmonary fibrosis. We checked these workers' influenza and pneumonia mortality data (ICD-10 codes J10-J18) in the national register. In total, 191 deaths, including 43 deaths from infectious pneumonia, occurred in 6158 person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up time 10.44 years). 'Some interstitial fibrosis' [hazard ratio (HR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-5.19, P=0.06] and 'definite interstitial fibrosis' (HR 3.70, 95% CI 1.22-11.23, P=0.02) were associated with an increased risk of death from pneumonia compared to no fibrosis. Asbestosis patients, i.e. those with both asbestos exposure and lung fibrosis, therefore appear to be particularly at risk for death from pneumonia. These patients should be vaccinated against influenza and Pneumococcus.
