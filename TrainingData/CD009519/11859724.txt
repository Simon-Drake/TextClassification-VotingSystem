[Internal strontium-89 radiotherapy for malignant bony metastasis].
OBJECTIVE: This work was done to evaluate the indication, effectiveness, and side effects of internal radiotherapy with radioactive nuclide strontium-89 (89Sr) in patients with malignant metastasis in the bone. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with skeletal metastasis received this internal radiotherapy. The patients were observed and followed up with respect to pain control, lesion improvement and side effects. RESULTS: The overall effective rate of pain control was 76.8% with the effective rate of prostatic cancer and breast cancer higher than 80%. The lesions in 81.8% patients as assessed by SPECT imaging, were improved. The mild lowering of white cells, platelets and red cells was the main side effect. CONCLUSION: Internal radiotherapy with 89Sr is very useful for patients with malignant cancer metastasis in the bone.
