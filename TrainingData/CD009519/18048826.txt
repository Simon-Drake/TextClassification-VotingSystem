Positron emission tomography for staging of pediatric sarcoma patients: results of a prospective multicenter trial.
PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for initial staging and therapy planning in pediatric sarcoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study, 46 pediatric patients (females, n = 22; males, n = 24; age range, 1 to 18 years) with histologically proven sarcoma (Ewing sarcoma family tumors, n = 23; osteosarcoma, n = 11; rhabdomyosarcoma, n = 12) were examined with conventional imaging modalities (CIMs), including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and bone scintigraphy according to the standardized algorithms of the international therapy optimization trials, and whole-body FDG-PET. A lesion- and patient-based analysis of PET alone and CIMs alone and a side-by-side (SBS) analysis of FDG-PET and CIMs were performed. The standard of reference consisted of all imaging material, follow-up data (mean follow-up time, 24 +/- 12 months), and histopathology and was determined by an interdisciplinary tumor board. RESULTS: FDG-PET and CIMs were equally effective in the detection of primary tumors (accuracy, 100%). PET was superior to CIMs concerning the correct detection of lymph node involvement (sensitivity, 95% v 25%, respectively) and bone manifestations (sensitivity, 90% v 57%, respectively), whereas CT was more reliable than FDG-PET in depicting lung metastases (sensitivity, 100% v 25%, respectively). The patient-based analysis revealed the best results for SBS, with 91% correct therapy decisions. This was significantly superior to CIMs (59%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In staging pediatric sarcoma, subsidiary FDG-PET scanning depicts important additional information and has a relevant impact on therapy planning when analyzed side-by-side with CIMs.
