[Peripheral lung adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma: evaluation with first-pass perfusion imaging using 64-detector row CT].
The aim of this study was to elucidate the characteristics of time attenuation curve and CT perfusion parameters for pulmonary adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. 58 cases of pulmonary adenocarcinomas and 27 cases of squamous cell carcinomas underwent first pass CT perfusion imaging with 64-row MDCT. Data were analyzed using commercial software to generate time attenuation curve (TAC) and CT perfusion parameters, including perfusion, peak enhanced (PE), time to peak (TTP), and blood volume (BV). For TAC, there were 36.2% of type I and 63.8% of type II in adenocarcinomas, while there were 22.2% of type I and 77.8% of type II in squamous cell carcinomas. There was not significant difference (P>0.05). Perfusion, PE, TTP and BV of adenocarcinomas were 63.2 +/- 45.4 ml x min(-1) x ml(-1), 60.2 +/- 46.6 Hu, 34.8 +/- 10.2 s and 34.3 +/- 23.6 ml x 100 g(-1), respectively, while 54.3 +/- 50.2 ml x min(-1) x ml(-1), 48.5 +/- 34.9 Hu, 36.1 +/- 11.2 s and 27.6 +/- 21.7 ml x 100 g(-1), for squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. No significant differences were found between groups (P>0.05). No significant differences in TAC and CT perfusion parameters were found between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.
