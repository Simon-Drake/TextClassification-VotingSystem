[CT screening for lung cancer].
Lung cancer is a common and serious disease, only early stage are curable. It is a logical candidate for a screening policy, especially as current and former smokers are easy to identify. The inefficiency of the chest radiograph is now proven, while the low-dose CT has shown promising data following a recent randomized study in North America. Yet, this is not specific and find a great number of benign anomalies. These limitations must be well known to physicians, radiologists and chest physicians if they use the individual screening.
