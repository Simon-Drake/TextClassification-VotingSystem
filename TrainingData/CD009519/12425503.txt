Mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung carcinoma using computed and positron-emission tomography.
BACKGROUND: We evaluated the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) in the mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Between May 14, 1999, and November 28, 2000, computerized tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) were used to clinically stage 94 consecutive patients with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (NSCCL). All patients underwent subsequent surgical staging with mediastinoscopy, anterior mediastinotomy, and/or thoracotomy with mediastinal lymphadenectomy. RESULTS: Overall accuracy was the same for both procedures. False-negative results occurred 3 times more often with CT; false-positive results occurred twice as often with PET. Sensitivity and specificity were 64% and 94%, respectively, for CT, versus 88% and 86%, respectively, for PET. Positive and negative predictive values were 80% and 88%, respectively, for CT, versus 71% and 95%, respectively, for PET. CONCLUSION: In addition to routine use of CT, PET seems to achieve high negative predictive value in the evaluation of mediastinal disease; PET seems particularly helpful in assessing absence of tumor in bulky nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
