Etiology of solitary extrapulmonary positron emission tomography and computed tomography findings in patients with lung cancer.
PURPOSE: The aim of this prospective study was to assess the incidence and the nature of solitary extrapulmonary [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulations in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staged with integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) and to evaluate the impact on management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 350 patients with NSCLC underwent whole-body PET/CT imaging. All solitary extrapulmonary FDG accumulations were evaluated by histopathology, further imaging, or clinical follow-up. RESULTS: PET/CT imaging revealed extrapulmonary lesions in 110 patients. In 72 patients (21%), solitary lesions were present. A diagnosis was obtained in 69 of these patients, including 37 (54%) with solitary metastases and 32 (46%) with lesions unrelated to the lung primary. Histopathologic examinations of these 32 lesions revealed a second clinically unsuspected malignancy or a recurrence of a previous diagnosed carcinoma in six patients (19%) and a benign tumor or inflammatory lesion in 26 patients (81%). The six malignancies consisted of carcinoma of the breast in two patients, and carcinoma of the orbit, esophagus, prostate, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in one patient each. Benign tumors and inflammatory lesions included eight colon adenomas, four Warthin's tumors, one granuloma of the lower jaw, one adenoma of the thyroid gland, one compensatory muscle activity due to vocal chord palsy, two occurrences of arthritis, three occurrences of reflux esophagitis, two occurrences of pancreatitis, two occurrences of diverticulitis, one hemorrhoidal inflammation, and one rib fracture. CONCLUSION: Solitary extrapulmonary FDG accumulations in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer should be analyzed critically for correct staging and optimal therapy, given that up to half of the lesions may represent unrelated malignancies or benign disease.
