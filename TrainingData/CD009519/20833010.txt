Staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): a review.
Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in Scotland, accounting for 28.9% of all cancer deaths in 2007. (1) Current guidelines recommend assessment of patient fitness and operability by a multi-disciplinary team when selecting management options. (2-6) Two of the most important prognostic markers are the stage of disease and ECOG performance status. The most commonly used cancer staging system is the tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system, which is maintained by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC). In 1998, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) established The Lung Cancer Staging Project, collecting data on over 100,000 patients diagnosed with lung cancer between 1990-2000 worldwide, in order to revise the 6th edition TNM staging system for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).(7) The 7th edition was published in late 2009. This review of staging in NSCLC, includes a summary of the different staging techniques currently available and the 7th edition TNM staging system for NSCLC.(8).
