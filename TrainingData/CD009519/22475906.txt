Occult colon cancer with initial cutaneous metastatic manifestation: PET/CT detection.
Skin metastasis as initial clinical presentation of occult internal organ malignancy is of rare occurrence, predominantly encountered in breast and lung cancer. The search for the occult causative primary malignancy is usually difficult with conventional anatomy-based cross-sectional imaging. The authors present a case of cecal cancer with thoracic and abdominal cutaneous metastasis demonstrated by PET/CT.
