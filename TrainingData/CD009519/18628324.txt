Mucoid impaction secondary to mucin-producing metastatic adenocarcinoma of the cervix.
Endobronchial metastases are an uncommon complication of malignant tumours. The vast majority are secondary to carcinoma of the breast, colorectum and kidney, or to melanoma. Occasionally, endobronchial tumours can result in partial or complete bronchial obstruction. Here, we describe an uncommon case of endobronchial metastasis of adenocarcinoma of the cervix causing mucoid impaction owing to mucous production by the tumour cells.
